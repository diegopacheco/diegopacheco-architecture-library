<p>This repository contains a curated collection of concepts, guidance about Software Architecture by Diego Pacheco.</p>
<p>I wrote this book because I'm doing software architecture for more than 20+ years and I want to share with other architects and wanna-be architects my philosophy, practices, and important concepts and patterns you should know. This also is an experiment. It's a live piece of advice that I want to improve over time.</p>

<p>IF you are a engineer you know we supose to start couting in ZERO. For some reason books always start on one, so I had to make this one start on <code>0</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rationale"><a class="header" href="#rationale">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>I wrote other books like Building Scala Applications, Principles of Software Architecture Modernisation and Continnous Modernization. This book is on the similar themes, however this is not a traditional book. It's a open source git book. It's only and you don't need to pay.</p>
<p>The tool I'm using here is very nice, it allow to search the whole book, in any page just type <code>/</code> in your keyboard and start typing what you want to search for. also because this book is written based on <code>markdown</code> it's very easy to link any page because you have a link per page.</p>
<p>Because I'm using git, I have history of all changes. Because this is made with software, I can update the book, so the book is versioned. Look on the footer of every page and you will see the version of the book.</p>
<p>This is a way for me to give it back. For free . I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-software-architect"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-software-architect">What is a Software Architect?</a></h2>
<p>A software architct is a person that makes desicions or influence decisions about the software structure, the technologies to be used, the patterns to be followed and the practices to be adopted. A software architect is responsible for the overall design and quality of the software system. A software architect code, does code review, mentors developers, leads technical discussions, defines standards and guidelines, evaluates technologies, and ensures that the software meets the requirements and goals of the business.</p>
<p>I like to think about a software architect as a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/02/the-monk-and-rockstar.html">Monk and Rockstar</a>. An architect also goes <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/shallow-vs-deep-mindset.html">DEEP</a> in the technology, understand the details, the trade offs, the pros and cons of different approaches. An architect also goes WIDE in the technology landscape, understand the trends, the best practices, the patterns, the anti-patterns, the tools and frameworks available.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-architecture"><a class="header" href="#what-is-architecture">What is Architecture?</a></h2>
<p>Software architecture is the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It defines the components, modules, and their interactions, as well as the principles and guidelines that govern the design and development of the software. Software architecture encompasses both the technical and non-technical aspects of the system, including performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and usability.</p>
<p>In other words, software architrecture is code. But not only code, but the decision on what to do and what not do. Software architecture is about making choices that will impact the software system in the long term.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-philosofy"><a class="header" href="#why-philosofy">Why Philosofy?</a></h1>
<p>Philosofy means "love of wisdom," and this project is dedicated to exploring and sharing philosophical ideas in an accessible way. The goal is to foster critical thinking, encourage open dialogue, and promote a deeper understanding of the world around us.</p>
<p>How we do things matters. There are many ways to do something wrong, but not as many ways to do it right. Philosofy is "ways of thinking", or "how approach" problems, day-by-day life, difficult situations, decisions, trade-offs.</p>
<p>Without a philosofy, we are likely to fall bad into bad habits, poor decisions, and unexamined beliefs. A well-defined philosofy helps us navigate life's complexities with clarity and purpose.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="crystal-ball"><a class="header" href="#crystal-ball">Crystal Ball</a></h1>
<p>Architects must have a good crystal ball. Requirements change, a requirement change can break completely the architecture if it was not designed to accommodate change. So thinking ahead is a great practice because it allows you to predict the next moves, meaning you think big and ahead but execute small.</p>
<p>Code can and should be refactored. Refactoring should happen all the time and continuously. However there are people who are allergic to refactoring and that is a recipe for great disasters. Thinking ahead allows you to be prepared when you need it. Think about fire drills, you practice how to handle fire, so when you need it you are ready.</p>
<p>Think big execute small.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-train-your-crystall-ball-skills"><a class="header" href="#how-to-train-your-crystall-ball-skills">How to Train your Crystall Ball skills?</a></h3>
<p>One simple way is paying attention on the industry and trends. You can learn from errors of others. Sometimes is not that technology or concept is bad but people apply it wrong and if they apply if wrong dependeding of the case can be a huge distaster like <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-death-of-microservices-distributed.html">Microservices when done wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Another form of crystall balling is to predict the next step, this one might sound harder but is not. Let me give you 3 examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You application has a product catalog</strong>: For sure you can start with simple exact math on the database. But if you grow and have hundreds of products you will need Full Text Search, so something like OpenSearch or ElasticSearch. So you can start thinking on how to integrate that in the future. You dont need it now, but you can get familir with, you can search the solution space, you can even get ready. When you need you are much better equiped to deal with.</li>
<li><strong>You have updates for the user</strong>: Which happen based on backend events, it's okay to use a old school polling mechanism, but if you think ahead you can start thinking on WebSockets or Server Sent Events. You can start learning how to implement that, so when you need it you are ready.</li>
<li><strong>You need to store files</strong>: You can start with relational database and store in a table(it's a anti-pattern), but if you think ahead you can start learning how to use S3 or MinIO. You can start learning how to integrate that, so when you need it you are ready.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="defensive-programing"><a class="header" href="#defensive-programing">Defensive Programing</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">Defensive programming</a> is a design approach that emphasizes anticipating and handling potential errors or unexpected inputs in software development. For instance you always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate inputs to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints.</li>
<li>Handle <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/09/proper-error-handling.html">exceptions gracefully</a> to prevent crashes and provide meaningful error messages.</li>
<li>Design functions and methods to be robust against invalid or unexpected inputs.</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/null-validations-and-exceptions.html">nulls</a> at all cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code should be resilient. It should not break that easily.</p>
<p>Considering the following sudo-code with Scala 3x:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">class ProducService(
    @Autowired productRepository: ProductRepository,
    @Autowired logger: Logger
){
    def saveProduct(val product: Product, ctx: Context): Either[String, Product] = {
        val messageId = ctx.getMessageId()
        if(product.price &lt; 0){
            val errorMsg = "Product price cannot be negative"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        if (isBannedProduct(product)){
            val errorMsg = "This product is banned"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        if (!isLegalProduct(product)){
            val errorMsg = "This product is not legal in your country"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        Right(productRepository.save(product))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You see that there is validations. We dont blindly trust the input. We check if the price is negative. If it is, we throw an exception. This is defensive programming in action.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="doing-hard-things"><a class="header" href="#doing-hard-things">Doing Hard Things</a></h1>
<p>Proper software is hard. It's a never ending war. Doing the right things means, teaching, socializing, influencing, enforcing, convincing, pushing back, standing your ground, and giving all sweat and blood to make the right things happen.</p>
<p>The best things in software are HARD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing the right design</li>
<li>Keeping discipline to write tests and have high diversity and coverage</li>
<li>Calling out and teaching team members with poor practices and wrong beliefs.</li>
<li>Pushing back poorly written tickets and requirements</li>
<li>Saying NO to "false shortcuts" (that lead to anti-patterns and tech debt)</li>
<li>Doing the right things everyday (invisible ant work)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps, the most difficult thing ever is dealing with monoliths and distributed monoliths. Modernization requires a very spesific and disciplined approach that is hard to do right. It requires patience, persistence, and a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>I'm convinced Distributed Monoliths are the #1 enemy of modern software architecture. Spawned across:</p>

<p>Architects must do HARD THINGS all the time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="frontend-vs-backend"><a class="header" href="#frontend-vs-backend">Frontend VS Backend</a></h1>
<p>Frontend by nature it's spesific. One react component, one page, one feature. Backend by nature it's generic. One api endpoint, serves manny features, many pages.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-thinking"><a class="header" href="#frontend-thinking">Frontend Thinking</a></h2>
<p>Tends to think 1:1. One component, one feature, one page. Which might be fine for frontend but not for backend. It's common to frontend engineers think that every single <code>fetch</code> they need todo should be a separate api endpoint(which leads to <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ConceptualIntegrity">lack of conceptual integrity</a>).</p>
<h2 id="backend-thinking"><a class="header" href="#backend-thinking">Backend Thinking</a></h2>
<p>Tends to think 1:many. One api endpoint, serves many features, many pages. Which might be fine for backend but not for frontend. By default backend services should be generic and reusable.</p>
<p>It's okay yo have many pages or many components but is not okay to have that many services. They should be generic, more centralizers, reusable by design.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="open-source-first"><a class="header" href="#open-source-first">Open Source First</a></h1>
<p>Open Source must be the default. Avoid proprietary software. Do not build wrappers for open source libraries. Use Open Source software directly. Building internal shared libraries is a liability and will create many issues like security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden, and lack of community support / documentation. Therefore creating internal shared libraries must be a very conscious choice and must be well justified.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="service-orientation"><a class="header" href="#service-orientation">Service Orientation</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2014/11/soa-micro-services-and-isolation.html">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a> is a big deal. <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-down-on-service-orientation.html">SOA</a> should be the default way of thinking and operating services in modern software architecture. Service Orientation should be the default choice for solutions. Services are more important and better than internal libraries.</p>
<p>Services allow Isolation, Independence and Flexibility. When services are done right, with proper contracts, refactor can happen under the hood. Services allow different stacks and technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/services.html">Services</a> should be Capability oriented. Services should be as generic as possible and it's okay to have more granularity and more code in a service. Services do not need to be micro(Micro Services).</p>
<p>The most important part of services is the contract. The contract is the API. The API should be as stable as possible. The API should be backward compatible as much as possible. The API should be well documented and versioned.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/04/its-all-about-contracts.html">Contracts</a> must be well designed and reviewed carefully, it's not difficult to make <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/leaky-contracts.html">poor contracts</a> because engineers and even more frontend engineers are just thinking on what needs to change, and are no thinking if is the right place to make the change or if sohuld be that way at all.</p>
<p>Services require a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/05/service-chain.html">lot of thinking</a>, they are not a panacea.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="protect-your-time"><a class="header" href="#protect-your-time">Protect Your Time</a></h1>
<p>It's very easy to be consumed with meetings 100% of the time. However the architect must protect his time in order to do deep work. Research, Monthly Reviews, Crystall Balling, thinking about trade-offs, evaluating solutions and reading code.</p>
<p>At minimun you should book at least 3x per week 3-6h to do deep work. Does not matter if is in the morning or aftermoon, whatever is easier. Hold your ground, push back, and protect that time. Architects must think.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-anti-patterns"><a class="header" href="#why-anti-patterns">Why Anti-Patterns?</a></h1>
<p>Everyboddy talks about patterns. Everything on the internet is "Best Prarctices". But people don't undersnd principles correctely, people think they understand when they actually don't.</p>
<p>I saw that lack of "proper application" happen over and over the years, with Agile, with Microservices, With DevOps, with Docker. If you dont understand the principles behind those "practices" you will end up doing anti-patterns.</p>
<p>Some anti-patterns are obvious and related to technology, but many anti-patterns are related to people, process, culture and how you work as a team. Also there are anti-patterns related to how architects behave or how they do not behave(and should behave).</p>
<p>It's important to know that is wrong, so you can avoid doing it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tech-debt-plague"><a class="header" href="#tech-debt-plague">Tech Debt Plague</a></h1>
<p>Tech debt is a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/01/breaking-debt-cycle.html">plague</a>. It's something that all companies suffer. It's normal to have tech debt. What is not correct is architects not fighting tech debt. Tech debt must be fought all the time. Either by simplifying requirements to avoid feature bloat, or by making better decisions that lead to better systems.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about this section, I was thinking on the terms of <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/04/tech-debt-first.html">"Tech Debt First"</a>. Because often I see tech debt being the "default choice", which is an anti-pattern. Some technical principles should be non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Imagine you are building a house, pretty sure the buyer does not expect the house to collapse 6 months later after buying it. So to cut corners you don't decide to use paper for walls, styrofoam for the roof and direct sunlight for electricity. However when we build software, bad management, bad architects and bad developers decide to cut corners to the point of making the software collapse after few months of being in production.</p>
<p>One classical example is skipping tests. Tests are not a nice to have, they are a must have. If you don't have tests, you are building a house without a foundation. You can build it fast, but sooner or later it will collapse. How will you do refactoring without tests? Management often push for such bad pratices but <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/06/dont-outsmart-hard-chooses-why.html">even architects(the bad ones)</a> push for that. Tests are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>You must fight the war, <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/01/quality-needs-to-be-managed.html">manage</a> <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/06/thoughts-on-internal-complexity.html">complexity</a> by doing improvements with the engineering team every week rather than "creating a jira ticket" that will never ever be addressed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ignore-culture"><a class="header" href="#ignore-culture">Ignore Culture</a></h1>
<p>If something is wrong. Say something, do something. When you ignore problems consistently over a long period of time, you end up developing this anti-pattern, which I called "Ignore Culture".</p>
<p>When you ignore warnings in the build, when you ignore old versions of libraries, when you ignore anti-patterns on the code. When you ignore production monitoring. When you ignore requirements that make no sense.</p>
<p>Does not matter if you were the one who did the code or not. You must take ownership and under your watch you should ignore nothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/03/ignoring-culture.html">Ignoring can become a culture</a> because managers can easily do this. Engineers, often pressured by managers also can ignore several wrong things. What's wrong should not be ignored, it should be fought and pushed back.</p>
<p>Lack of fighting for what is right is immaturity. As an architect you must not ignore what's wrong. Do not let this become a culture. Ignore culture can happen so easily when people say "It's not my job", or "It's not my code" or "It's not my project" or "It's not my responsibility", the extreme lack of ownership can lead to ignore culture.</p>
<p>When you are ignoring problems you are making fertile ground for anti-patterns to grow. Tech debt plague requires ignore culture to thrive.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stagnation"><a class="header" href="#stagnation">Stagnation</a></h1>
<p>Architects must be like the Rolling Stones, they don't gather moss. Architects must be <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/11/being-active-architect.html">active</a> in a constant state of learning, always reading books, always reading papers, always reading code, always ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>If an architect stops learning, they stagnate, and stagnation is the death of architecture. Think about a coin, a coin that has no circulation is a worthless coin. An architect that has no new knowledge is a worthless architect.</p>
<p>As architect you cannot become old school. You must be always looking for new ideas, new technologies, new patterns, new anti-patterns, new ways of doing the old things. Being stuck on the past has terrible consequences. The architect is the most influential person or it should be. So what are you influencing?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h1>
<p>Mind blown by me saying <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/01/requirements-are-dangerous.html">"Requirements"</a> is an anti-pattern? Lean believes that requirements are just a decision that somebody made. Now what you need to ask yourself is, how good is this decision? Architecture is the art of making good decisions. Bad decisions COST a lot, not only money but also time, effort and frustration.</p>
<p>Architects <code>MUST</code> make good decisions. Good decisions are made when you have the right information, the right context and the right experience. You must be prepared to make right decisions. In the beginning you will make mistakes, which is okay if you learn from them and that's why you need Architecture Review.</p>
<p>Not all Requirements are anti-patterns, but seeing them as "requirements" is an anti-pattern per se. The word requirements, and often how people take it, implies that something is fixed, immutable and unchangeable. In reality, requirements are always changing, evolving and adapting to new circumstances. Good architects embrace change and adapt their decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>When a project starts, or when you start a task, it's very common that product did not think a lot about the consequences, trade-offs, corner cases, implications and or even what the engineering team needs to get it done. The most common anti-pattern is empty jira tickets and tons of meetings to push the "discovery work" to engineering.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with engineering collaborating with product, as long as we mark that as "Discovery work". The issue is, product pushes "not ready" tickets to development and asks: "Why is this not done yet?" then corners are cut, quality is compromised and technical debt is added. Remember the Tech Debt Plague and Ignoring culture, they are all connected.</p>
<p>You need to see requirements as "Temporary decisions", not as martial law. You need to deliver requirements, but you must challenge them, you must question them and you must validate them. If you don't, you are just a delivery team, not an engineering team.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-dilemmas"><a class="header" href="#why-dilemmas">Why Dilemmas?</a></h1>
<p>Dilemma is a situation where a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, especially ones that are equally undesirable. Dilemmas often arise in various aspects of architecture like decision-making, and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Every single architect will face dilemmas, some dillamas are very common and part of any system or software developement. It's important to talk about dilemmas because no one talks about them.</p>
<p>Having good perspectived allow you to make informed and balanced decisions. Consider this as a compass to navigate dilemmas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="discovery-vs-delivery"><a class="header" href="#discovery-vs-delivery">Discovery Vs Delivery</a></h1>
<p>Discovery is the moment where you are trying to figure out what to build in order to solve a problem for your users. Discovery is heavily around product and user research, prototyping, testing ideas and validating assumptions.</p>
<p>However it's also necessary to have someone from technology doing discovery otherwise you transfer slowness, confusion and risk even to be attempting to build something that is not feasible or too complex to deliver.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/02/multi-track-agile-with-tta.html">Delivery</a> should be focusing on engineering and once we know what to build(often captured as requirements and figma prototypes for the frontend) we can start building it. The question is how do I build it right. Sounds simple right? But here we have one of the biggest dilemmas in software development.</p>
<p>If you just go from discovery to delivery you are very likely working in a waterfall fashion. So this is not linear, but (which I consider an anti-pattern), happens all the time, the moment you touch discovery, people assume discovery is done or correct and then you only care about shipping it fast.</p>
<p>You need speed, but it's not just speed of delivery but actually speed of learning. The goal is to learn fast. Sometimes you can learn before production but often times you can only go to production to learn.</p>
<p>If you need to go to production fast to learn, should we embrace the <code>Tech Debt plague</code> and be <code>Tech Debt First</code>? No. Because you might learn what the users want or don't want, you might find what can bring revenue to the company but the code is there(likely forever) and we need to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-roads-approach.html">balance</a> this. So you can't just <code>pick a side</code> you need to balance both sides.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="move-it-fast-or-do-it-right"><a class="header" href="#move-it-fast-or-do-it-right">Move it Fast or Do it Right?</a></h1>
<p>Facebook and silicon valley culture often emphasize speed and rapid iteration in product development. The mantra "Move Fast and Break Things" encapsulates this ethos, encouraging teams to prioritize quick delivery and innovation over meticulous planning and perfection.</p>
<p>However even Facebook admitted that they need to shift to a more balanced approach where they move fast but with stable infrastructure. It's important to do it right, in engineering, however if you build right the <code>wrong product</code>, the product people don't care, then you are wasting your time and money.</p>
<p>However it's not as simple as, then build it all fast, and all expedient, and pile up tech debt like the Tech debt plague. You will get the right product, but a poor experience, because it will be slow, full of bugs, and unreliable.</p>
<p>Again this refers to the dilemma of Discovery vs Delivery. You need to find the right balance between moving fast to discover what works and doing it right to ensure quality and reliability.</p>
<p>In theory you could "just move fast" but the issue is, lots of companies are allergic to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/11/continuous-refactoring.html">refactoring</a> and they never pay the price to improve the code. Mostly because tech leadership is bad and or immature. But either way, you need to pay the price at some point. If you never pay the price, you end up with a big ball of mud that is hard to maintain and evolve.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="build-vs-buy"><a class="header" href="#build-vs-buy">Build vs Buy</a></h1>
<p>Which one is best, build or buy? Well, it depends. Build is important when is your core domain and is how your companies makes money and differentiates from the competition. If all the companies by the same core business, how are they different? They are not.</p>
<p>However when is not your core business, buy makes a lot of sense, because is freeing time for you to focus on what matters, your core business. Howeber this is a big mistake here. There is no buy without build. Because even if you buy you will need integrate with your existing systems. Just because your <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/proprietary-systems-and-distributed.html">buy does not means is perfect</a>, does not means it fixes all your problems. It's also comon when you buy solution that same solutions introduce problems that you did not have before. Buy has <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/06/software-architecture-hidden-costs.html">hidden costs</a>.</p>
<p>When buying it's important to observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are APIs</li>
<li>Evaluate the APIs before buying</li>
<li>Buy the code (when possible)</li>
<li>Consider integration as part of the cost</li>
<li>Consider troubleshooting, debugging, observability as part of the cost</li>
</ul>
<p>If I use an AWS service, vs building in house is cheaper? Well dependends where you want put the money. In the beginning buying might sound cheaper, but you will pay AWS forever. When you build you might have a better solution(if executed right) but you now need pay people to mantaining it forever. So where you want the money goes, your people or vendors? The question here is how good you are in execution inside of the house. If your execution is terrible, go buy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decide-or-wait"><a class="header" href="#decide-or-wait">Decide or Wait</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/04/lean-deming-the-new-culture.html">Lean</a> belive that late decisions are often better than rushed ones. However, waiting too long can lead to missed opportunities. As time pass, you will be more equiped about whatt's best, thay it's always easier to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/01/refactoring-making-sense-of-invisible.html">refactor</a> later(If the cost is not too high).</p>
<p>Decisions are process, they they should not be written on the stone. Deciding something is process, it allow us to move on, however we should be challenging our past decisions, that's why time to reflect and think is importat. Architects need protect they time to have time to think. Engineering teams must have retrospectives to reflect on past decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes is too soon to decide, you might not have data or not be sure. You must balance the cost of waiting vs the cost of deciding now. Lean has a tool to deal with this called <code>cost of delay</code>. If the cost of delay is low, you can wait more, if it's high you must decide now.</p>
<p>Experimentation is a good way to make temporary decisions, and them figureout what stick and what does not stick. You can try A/B testing, feature flags, or prototypes to gather data and make informed decisions later. Deciding and waiting are not mutually exclusive, they require balance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-properties"><a class="header" href="#why-properties">Why Properties?</a></h1>
<p>Properties are characteristics or attributes that define or describe an object, system, or concept. Properties give us benefits. Without architecture properties, we would be lost in a sea of ambiguity and confusion.</p>
<p>Properties are things you really want for your architecture and systems. Think about a kid, you want your son or daughter to have good properties like honesty, kindness, and respectfulness. Similarly, in architecture and systems, we want properties that ensure scalability, security, and observability.</p>
<p>Some properties are obvious, others are non-obvious. But if you know they exist you can make explict work to make sure theu are present in your architecture and systems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="anti-fragility"><a class="header" href="#anti-fragility">Anti-Fragility</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/09/devops-is-about-anti-fragility-not-only.html">Anti-fragility</a> is a property of systems that not only withstand shocks and stressors but also improve and grow stronger as a result of them. Unlike resilience, which focuses on maintaining stability in the face of adversity, anti-fragile systems thrive on volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In order to achive anti-fragility you need Defensive Programing and Chaos Engineering. You must test that your system is tolerant and can recover from failure. So you induce and provoke failure in your system and infrastrcuture to proove when necessary.</p>
<p>You do not want discover in production if the system can recover from failure, you want to know before hand. You want to know that your system is anti-fragile. Testing in production is not the same as discovering in production. Testing in production means, guard-rails and testing in production environment but without impacting real users.</p>
<p>Your systems must be anti-fragile. You architevture must be anti-fragile. Your infrastructure must be anti-fragile. To be anti-fragile you need lots of hypotethesis and experiments to proove your system is anti-fragile. Anti-fragility requires <code>science</code> and <code>creativity</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state-of-the-art"><a class="header" href="#state-of-the-art">State of the Art</a></h1>
<p>If you will be building something. Why start with something deprecated? Why not use the latest versions? State of the art is not about just using the latest and greates versions but also picking the best solutions.</p>
<p>Why not pick the best database? why not pick the best language? why not pick the best framework? why not pick the best architecture?</p>
<p>We should be creating the best architecture and the best solitions, just going with the "standards" is a path to stagnation.</p>
<p>This might sound impossible, but it's nt. It just requires more research and more effort. But is 100% doable and should be done.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scalability"><a class="header" href="#scalability">Scalability</a></h1>
<p>A good architect, produce good architecture. Architecture is embedided in code. Good code is scalable code.</p>
<p>Scalability it's not only for systems, it's also for engineering teams. A good architecture allows teams to work in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.</p>
<p>Good Structure, good design, allow engineers to be more productive, and focus on delivering value, instead of fighting with the codebase. You want the architects you produce to have this properties.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="observable"><a class="header" href="#observable">Observable</a></h1>
<p>As architect, the systems you produce must have the ability to be observable. Such property is very important. Consider <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/observability-domain-observability-from.html">observability</a> a sub-set of <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/02/going-faster-with-testing.html">testing</a> which happens in production.</p>
<p>IF you dont know whats going on you are driving into the dark. You want to be able to understand how your system behaves in production, and be able to detect issues before they become problems for your users.</p>
<p>Without such understanding, you are not doing the whole cycle correctly. Building something following a design is not enought. You need to observe the final product in production, and be able to learn from it and improve it.</p>
<p>Making Observable systems, imply in having:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper Logging</li>
<li>Exposing custom application metrics</li>
<li>Have latency distribution metrics for upstream and doewnstream dependencies.</li>
<li>Having proper Message Ids.</li>
<li>Having the pratice of look the production monitoring dashboards and logs as part of your daily routine and retrofit the learnings to the engineering team.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stability"><a class="header" href="#stability">Stability</a></h1>
<p>Not only your architecture but your systems must be stable. Being <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-stability-mindset.html">stable is a state</a>, which means they are not broken all the time. Systems should not be broken. It's impossible not never break the system, after all we are only humans. However this is not an excuse for lack of attention, carelessness or poor practices.</p>
<p>A stable system is one where, whre most of times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build is passing</li>
<li>Tests are passing, in all environments</li>
<li>Deployments are successful</li>
<li>Monitoring shows healthy metrics in production</li>
<li>Tech debt is being managed</li>
</ul>
<p>A stable architecture is one where:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reality in concepts with confidence</li>
<li>You can make changes without breaking things</li>
<li>You can onboard new team members without much friction</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="secure"><a class="header" href="#secure">Secure</a></h1>
<p>Software must be secure. Architects should prioritize security in their designs to protect data and maintain user trust. Lack of security runs brands, trust is damaged, and legal consequences may arise.</p>
<p>Security means implementing measures to protect systems from threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. This includes practices like <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/11/why-encryption-is-so-hard.html">encryption</a>, authentication, authorization, <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/tokenization-encryption-and.html">tokenization</a> and regular security audits.</p>
<p>Common considerations for secure architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Protection</strong>: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Keep software and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects need to know security. Architecture must be designed with security in mind from the outset, rather than being an afterthought. This includes threat modeling, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring for potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>By prioritizing security in software architecture, organizations can safeguard their systems, protect user data, and maintain trust with their users.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-pratices"><a class="header" href="#why-pratices">Why Pratices?</a></h1>
<p>Architecture is not just about technology. architecture is also about people, and what and how you work with team.</p>
<p>The way you work matter, what you do and what you dont do(conciously) also matter.</p>
<p>Pratices are about "how you do things", the way you approach problems, day-by-day life, difficult situations, decisions, trade-offs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attention-to-detail"><a class="header" href="#attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</a></h1>
<p>Architects must be meticulous in their work, ensuring that every aspect of a design is carefully considered and executed. <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/10/its-all-about-attention.html">Attention to detail</a> is crucial for creating functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing structures. Here are some key areas where attention to detail is essential.</p>
<p>Architects pays close attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code: Classes, Internal design, contracts, patterns/anti-patterns</li>
<li>Tests: Are they passing?, how good they are? do we have good diversity? coverage?</li>
<li>Production Logs: Are there any errors? warnings? anomalies?</li>
<li>Production Dashboards: Are all metrics within expected ranges?</li>
<li>Error Tracking: Are there any new issues? recurring issues? We should have ZERO EXCEPTIONS.</li>
<li>Performance Metrics: Are we meeting our performance goals? any regressions?</li>
<li>Security Audits: Are there any vulnerabilities? are we compliant with security standards?</li>
<li>Requirements: Are we meeting all specified requirements? any missing features?</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects are critical and detail-oriented when it comes to every since tech detail.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="architecture-review"><a class="header" href="#architecture-review">Architecture Review</a></h1>
<p>IF you dont have anything written, how can we review it? How can you comunicate with the engineering team? How can you onboard new team members?</p>
<p>Architecture must be written down, at the minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall Architecture Diagram</li>
<li>Key Decisions (with rationale)</li>
<li>Important <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/07/tradeoffs.html">Trade-offs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Arch documentation can be done with a markdown file, here is a good template: https://github.com/diegopacheco/tech-resources/blob/master/arch-doc-template.md</p>
<p>When you write down, principles, decisions, guidance, and trade-offs become explicit, easier to communicate, and easier to review. Diagrams help a lot, specially overal architecture diagram, class diagram are very useful.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="design-first"><a class="header" href="#design-first">Design First</a></h1>
<p>Architects must think. They must produce the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/04/design-is-not-subjective.html">design</a> before the implementation. Howeever that's only possible if the architect master the problem domain and the technology being used. If that does not happen, Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are a great way to explore the problem and the technology before the design is produced.</p>
<p>Writting down the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html">design</a> is also a great way to communicate it to the team and get feedback. The <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/design-101.html">design</a> should be a living document that evolves with the project. IF you jump executing all times you are doing just tatical programing(Philosophy of software design).</p>
<p>If you move before you think, tech debt will happen, bad decisions will happen.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ownership"><a class="header" href="#ownership">Ownership</a></h1>
<p>Architects must have <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/11/expectations.html">extreme ownership</a>. They are responsible for the success and failure of the architecture they design. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the architecture meets business requirements.</li>
<li>Continuously evaluating and improving the architecture.</li>
<li>Collaborating with development teams to ensure proper implementation.</li>
<li>Staying updated with industry trends and best practices.</li>
<li>Documenting architectural decisions and their rationale.</li>
<li>Advocating for the architecture within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects must be proatice. Architects are always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking: Thinking ahead about future changes and how the architecture can accommodate them.</li>
<li>Performing Research: Researching new technologies and patterns that can improve the architecture.</li>
<li>Socializing: Communicating, educating, influencing effectively with stakeholders to ensure alignment and understanding of the architecture.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reading-code"><a class="header" href="#reading-code">Reading Code</a></h1>
<p>I know this might sound silly. But Architects need to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/training-like-pros.html">read the code</a>, they should go download the code and read it. Not only read it but <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/code-analysis-at-scale.html">analyze</a> it. Reading the code allow the architect to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the complexity of the system</li>
<li>See the anti-patterns on the code</li>
<li>Understand what the system does</li>
</ul>
<p>Many meetings can be saved if people just read the code. Architects must be Hackers, they need to read the code. Read the system code, read the libraries code, read the frameworks code. Reading code is not a one time thing, is a everyday thing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monthly-review"><a class="header" href="#monthly-review">Monthly Review</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2019/11/getting-best-out-github-with-remote.html">Code review</a> is great. Architects should do <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2018/07/lessons-learned-and-experiences-doing.html">Code review</a>. However code review is pretty much focused on deltas. Which is not the whole story.</p>
<p>Code review happens in-clycle, meaning every week, every day, or pretty much every time a ticket/PR is done. We also need a off-cycle review.</p>
<p>As an architect, 1x per month or at least 1x per quarter you should look the whole codebase. Why? Beause them you are not looking the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/beyond-code-deltas.html">detlas</a>, you are lookign the whole picture and seeing the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2011/04/team-code-review-design-sessions.html">design</a>.</p>
<p>Such pratice is important to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural concept drift: Are we still following the intended architecture? Are there parts of the code that have diverged from the original design principles?</li>
<li>Code quality trends: Is the overall code quality improving or deteriorating? Are there areas that need refactoring or technical debt reduction?</li>
<li>Consistency: Are coding standards and best practices being followed consistently across the codebase?</li>
<li>New patterns and anti-patterns: Are there new design patterns emerging that could be beneficial? Are there anti-patterns that need to be addressed?</li>
<li>Testing Diversity: Is the test coverage adequate? Are there areas that lack sufficient testing? Do we need new forms of testing and induction?</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="working-on-trenches"><a class="header" href="#working-on-trenches">Working on Trenches</a></h1>
<p>Lean has this principle of "Gemba" which means "the real place" in Japanese. It emphasizes the importance of going to the actual place where work is done to understand processes and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>Software is a war that never ends. Architects need to be on the battle front, on the trenches with engineers. Architects should not fix all the problems and code all the stories. However they need to code, they need to help the team to deal with complex problems. Architects going there and helping the team is away to prevent a timeline disruption. Otherwise what <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/02/architects-as-gatekeepers.html">kind of architect</a> are you?</p>
<p>Architects on the frontend is also how they can understand the real problems the team is facing. Architects cannot be hands off.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-concepts"><a class="header" href="#why-concepts">Why Concepts?</a></h1>
<p>Without know key concepts you did not really learned something properly. Knowing concepts, allow you to build mental models that help you understand new information faster and better.</p>
<p>Without mental models you are just memorizing information, and that is not a good way to learn and worst way to operate. Mental models can only be build with proper understanding of concepts.</p>
<p>Having good mental moels is a game changer, because it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn new things faster</li>
<li>Understand complex topics better</li>
<li>Make better decisions</li>
<li>Solve problems more effectively</li>
<li>Communicate ideas clearly</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> it's a property of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures. It's a RELATIONAL database concept.</p>
<h2 id="a--atomicity"><a class="header" href="#a--atomicity">A == Atomicity</a></h2>
<p>Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, which either completely succeeds or completely fails.</p>
<p>If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="c--consistency"><a class="header" href="#c--consistency">C == Consistency</a></h2>
<p>Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining all predefined rules, such as constraints, cascades, and triggers.</p>
<h2 id="i--isolation"><a class="header" href="#i--isolation">I == Isolation</a></h2>
<p>Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.</p>
<p>This prevents transactions from reading uncommitted data from other transactions, which could lead to inconsistencies.</p>
<h2 id="d--durability"><a class="header" href="#d--durability">D == Durability</a></h2>
<p>Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. Committed data is saved to non-volatile storage, ensuring that it is not lost. Usualy using a WAL (Write Ahead Log) to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="authentication"><a class="header" href="#authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">Authentication</a> is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. Common methods of authentication include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords (very bad)</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>
<li>Biometric verification</li>
<li>OAuth tokens</li>
<li>API keys</li>
<li>Single Sign-On (SSO)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authorization"><a class="header" href="#authorization">Authorization</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization">Authorization</a> is the process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It defines the permissions and access levels for different resources. Common authorization models include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</li>
<li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li>
<li>IAM (Identity and Access Management) systems</li>
<li>Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)</li>
<li>Policy as Code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entitlements"><a class="header" href="#entitlements">Entitlements</a></h2>
<p>Entitlements refer to the specific rights or privileges granted to a user or system after authentication and authorization. They define what actions can be performed on specific resources. Examples of entitlements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access a product catalog (invisible by default)</li>
<li>See premium content</li>
<li>See premium features</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="base"><a class="header" href="#base">BASE</a></h1>
<p>A concept from NOSQL databases.
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-acid-and-base-database/">BASE</a> systems prioritize availability instead of immediate consistency.</p>
<h2 id="base-properties"><a class="header" href="#base-properties">BASE Properties</a></h2>
<p>BASE is an acronym that describes the consistency model used by many NoSQL systems. It stands for:</p>
<p>BA == Basically Available</p>
<p>The system guarantees availability - it will always respond to requests, even if the response contains stale or inconsistent data. The database remains operational even when parts of the system fail.</p>
<p>S == Soft state
The state of the system may change over time, even without new input, due to eventual consistency. Data doesn't have to be immediately consistent across all nodes.</p>
<p>E == Eventual consistency
Given enough time without new updates, all replicas will eventually converge to the same value. The system doesn't guarantee immediate consistency but promises that consistency will be achieved eventually.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="idepotency"><a class="header" href="#idepotency">IDEPOTENCY</a></h1>
<p>It's a interesting property that allow the same operation to be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.</p>
<p>In REST APIs, idempotency is an important concept, especially for HTTP methods. Here are some common HTTP methods like GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GET</strong>: The most famous and common Idempotent. Retrieving a resource multiple times does not change its state.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Idepotency</a> it's important because if the same request arrives twice(there is not side effects), the server can safely ignore the second request or return the same result as the first one without any unintended consequences or just re-process the samething again without issues.</p>
<p>Such principle keep us from writing complex software. For instance if a GET operation also does inserts and deletes, we would have to handle the case where the same GET request is sent multiple times, which could lead to data inconsistency and unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>So we want honor the idempotency principle to keep our software simple and predictable.</p>

<p><strong>Pessimistic locking</strong>: assumes that conflicts will occur and therefore locks the resource for exclusive access when a transaction begins. This approach is suitable for environments with high contention, as it prevents other transactions from modifying the resource until the lock is released. However, it can lead to reduced concurrency and potential deadlocks.</p>
<p><strong>Optimistic locking</strong>: assumes that conflicts are rare and allows multiple transactions to access the resource concurrently. Instead of locking the resource, it checks for conflicts only when a transaction attempts to commit changes. If a conflict is detected, the transaction is rolled back and can be retried. This approach is more efficient in low-contention environments, as it maximizes concurrency and minimizes locking overhead.</p>
<p>Optimistic locking is often implemented using versioning, where each resource has a version number that is checked and updated during transactions. If the version number has changed since the transaction began, it indicates a conflict.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="partition"><a class="header" href="#partition">Partition</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>partition</strong> of a set is a way of dividing the data set into subsets such that every element in the original set is included in exactly one of the subsets. In other words, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(database)">partition</a> breaks down a set into distinct parts where no part shares any elements with another, and all parts together cover the entire original set.</p>
<p>Partition by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific column or set of columns</li>
<li>A specific number of partitions</li>
<li>A specific size of each partition</li>
<li>A specific percentage of data in each partition</li>
<li>A specific condition or rule</li>
<li>A random distribution of data into partitions</li>
<li>Consistent hashing for distributed systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Partitions matter because they can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of data processing tasks. Proper partitioning can lead to faster query execution, reduced data shuffling, and improved resource utilization in distributed computing environments.</p>
<p>When designing partitions, consider factors such as data distribution, query patterns, and the underlying storage system to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="schema-evolution"><a class="header" href="#schema-evolution">Schema Evolution</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution">Schema evolution</a> is the practice of changing data structures, API contracts, or message formats over time while maintaining compatibility with existing clients and services. This is critical for zero-downtime deployments in distributed systems.</p>
<h2 id="forward-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#forward-compatibility">Forward Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Forward compatibility means that old code can read data written by new code. The old system can safely ignore new fields it doesn't understand.</p>
<p>When adding new fields to a schema:</p>
<ul>
<li>New fields should be optional with sensible defaults</li>
<li>Old services can process new messages by ignoring unknown fields</li>
<li>Allows deploying new producers before updating consumers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Backward compatibility means that new code can read data written by old code. The new system must handle the absence of fields that didn't exist in older versions.</p>
<p>When reading old data:</p>
<ul>
<li>New code must provide defaults for missing fields</li>
<li>New services can process old messages correctly</li>
<li>Allows deploying new consumers before updating producers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breaking-changes"><a class="header" href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</a></h2>
<p>Breaking changes destroy compatibility and require coordinated deployments. Avoid these whenever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing required fields</li>
<li>Changing field types</li>
<li>Renaming fields without aliasing</li>
<li>Changing field semantics</li>
<li>Making optional fields required</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safe-schema-changes"><a class="header" href="#safe-schema-changes">Safe Schema Changes</a></h2>
<p>Safe changes maintain compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding optional fields with defaults</li>
<li>Removing optional fields</li>
<li>Adding new enum values at the end</li>
<li>Adding new message types</li>
<li>Deprecating fields instead of removing them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="versioning-strategies"><a class="header" href="#versioning-strategies">Versioning Strategies</a></h2>
<p><strong>URL Versioning</strong>: Different versions in the URL path like <code>/api/v1/users</code> and <code>/api/v2/users</code></p>
<p><strong>Header Versioning</strong>: Version specified in request headers like <code>Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json</code></p>
<p><strong>Content Negotiation</strong>: Different media types for different versions</p>
<p><strong>No Versioning</strong>: Evolve schema compatibly without explicit versions. Requires discipline but provides best flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="migration-strategies"><a class="header" href="#migration-strategies">Migration Strategies</a></h2>
<p><strong>Expand-Contract Pattern</strong>: Three-phase deployment for breaking changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand: Add new field alongside old field</li>
<li>Migrate: Update all services to use new field</li>
<li>Contract: Remove old field after migration complete</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shadow Reading</strong>: New code reads both old and new formats, writes only new format</p>
<p><strong>Feature Flags</strong>: Toggle between old and new behavior at runtime</p>
<h2 id="database-schema-evolution"><a class="header" href="#database-schema-evolution">Database Schema Evolution</a></h2>
<p>Database schemas require special care because data persists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use migrations that can run without downtime</li>
<li>Add columns as nullable first, backfill data, then make required</li>
<li>Drop columns in separate deployment after code stops using them</li>
<li>Use views or aliases to maintain old column names during transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Schema evolution is not optional in production systems. Every change must consider compatibility to avoid outages during deployments.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="source-of-truth"><a class="header" href="#source-of-truth">SOURCE OF TRUTH</a></h1>
<p>It's concept that means what database or system is considered the authoritative source for a particular piece of information. It's comon in distributed systems to have multiple databases or even systems that store the same data. In such cases, it's crucial to designate one of these as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">"source of truth"</a> to ensure consistency and reliability of the data across the entire system.</p>
<p>The same concept is used in migrations. While you are migrating from System A to System B, System A is the source of truth until the migration is complete and verified. After that, System B becomes the new source of truth.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_statelessness_principle">designing services</a>, one of the key architectural decisions is whether to implement them as stateless or stateful. Stales teless services do not retain any information about previous interactions, while stateful services maintain state information across multiple requests.</p>
<p>It's much easier to work with stateless services because they can scale more easily, recover from failures faster, and are generally simpler to manage. However, there are scenarios where stateful services are necessary, such as when maintaining user sessions or handling transactions.</p>
<p>Staless does not means that the service cannot use state at all; rather, it means that the service itself does not store state between requests. Instead, any necessary state can be stored in external systems like databases or caches. Stateful service are more complex.</p>

<p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Primarily focuses on managing and routing API requests. It handles tasks such as request transformation, response aggregation, authentication, and rate limiting. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load Balancer</strong>: Primarily focuses on distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

<p>The <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/bff-dilema.html">Backend for Frontend(BFF)</a> pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored to the specific needs of different frontend applications. Usually written in a language that is common for the frontend team, meaning: NodeJS with JS ot Typescript.</p>
<p>BFFs should have <code>Rendering Logic</code> and should NEVER have <code>Business Logic</code> because that should be encapsulated in the core backend services.</p>
<h2 id="bffs-are"><a class="header" href="#bffs-are">BFFs Are</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend-Specific</strong>: Each BFF is designed and optimized for a specific frontend application.</li>
<li><strong>Team Ownership</strong>: The team that builds the frontend typically owns and maintains its BFF.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation Layer</strong>: BFFs aggregate data from multiple downstream services.</li>
<li><strong>Tailored Responses</strong>: Returns only the data the frontend needs in the format it expects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bff-vs-api-gateway"><a class="header" href="#bff-vs-api-gateway">BFF vs API Gateway</a></h2>
<p>While both BFF and API Gateway sit between frontends and backend services, they serve different purposes:</p>
<p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Provides common functionality like authentication, rate limiting, and routing. It serves all clients with the same generic interface.</p>
<p><strong>BFF</strong>: Tailors the API specifically to each frontend's needs. It aggregates, transforms, and optimizes responses for a specific client type. Rendering logic is part of the BFF.</p>

<h2 id="publishsubscribe-pattern"><a class="header" href="#publishsubscribe-pattern">Publish/Subscribe Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Publishers send messages to a topic or channel without knowing who will receive them. Subscribers express interest in specific topics and receive all messages published to those topics.</p>
<p>Pub/Sub Nature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-to-Many</strong>: A single message can be delivered to multiple subscribers.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: Publishers and subscribers don't need to know about each other.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Subscription</strong>: Subscribers can join or leave at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Topic-Based</strong>: Messages are organized by topics or channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pub/Sub Use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time notifications across multiple services</li>
<li>Event-driven architectures where multiple consumers need the same data</li>
<li>Log aggregation and monitoring systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="point-to-point-pattern"><a class="header" href="#point-to-point-pattern">Point-to-Point Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Messages are sent directly from one sender to one specific receiver. Messages are typically placed in a queue where they are consumed by a single consumer.</p>
<p>P2P:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-to-One</strong>: Each message is consumed by exactly one receiver.</li>
<li><strong>Message Ordering</strong>: Messages are typically processed in the order they arrive.</li>
<li><strong>Load Distribution</strong>: Multiple consumers can read from the same queue for load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Delivery</strong>: Messages remain in the queue until successfully processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>P2P Use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task distribution among worker nodes</li>
<li>Request-response communication between services</li>
<li>Sequential processing of transactions</li>
<li>Background job processing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="request-reply-pattern"><a class="header" href="#request-reply-pattern">Request-Reply Pattern</a></h2>
<p>A pattern where a sender sends a message and waits for a response from the receiver. The sender includes a reply-to address in the message so the receiver knows where to send the response.
This pattern combines aspects of both synchronous and asynchronous communication, allowing for non-blocking request-response interactions.</p>
<h2 id="message-ordering"><a class="header" href="#message-ordering">Message Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Message ordering guarantees vary by pattern and implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIFO Ordering</strong>: Messages are processed in the order they are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Partition Ordering</strong>: Messages within the same partition maintain order.</li>
<li><strong>No Ordering</strong>: Messages may be processed in any order for maximum throughput.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="message-id"><a class="header" href="#message-id">Message Id</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID">Message ID</a> Also know as CORRELATION_ID. The idea that each message or request must have a uniqui id, and you will pass down such id into the dowstream services. Via headers or other means. When you log anything you also log the MESSAGE_ID.</p>
<p>Why this is important?</p>
<ul>
<li>Traceability: When you have a unique MESSAGE_ID for each request, you can trace the entire lifecycle of that request across multiple services. This is especially useful in microservices architectures where a single user action may trigger multiple service calls.</li>
<li>Debugging: If an error occurs, having a MESSAGE_ID allows you to quickly locate all logs and events related to that specific request. This can significantly speed up the debugging process.</li>
<li>Monitoring: MESSAGE_IDs can be used to monitor the performance of requests as they pass through</li>

<p>without a MESSAGE_ID, it because impossible to debug distrubuted systems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pagination"><a class="header" href="#pagination">Pagination</a></h1>
<p>When you have a endpoint that returns a large list of items, it is often useful to <a href="https://www.merge.dev/blog/rest-api-pagination">paginate</a> the results. This means breaking the results into smaller chunks, or "pages", that can be retrieved one at a time.</p>
<p>Basic benefit here is to reduce the amount of data transferred in a single request, which can improve performance and reduce load on the server. Less latency and more responsive applications are the end result.</p>
<h2 id="pagination-strategies"><a class="header" href="#pagination-strategies">Pagination Strategies</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offset-Based Pagination</strong>: This is the most common method, where the client specifies an offset (the starting point) and a limit (the number of items to return). For example, <code>GET /items?offset=20&amp;limit=10</code> would return items 21-30.</li>
<li><strong>Cursor-Based Pagination</strong>: Instead of using an offset, this method uses a cursor (a unique identifier for a specific item) to mark the starting point for the next page of results. For example, <code>GET /items?cursor=abc123&amp;limit=10</code> would return the next 10 items after the item with the cursor <code>abc123</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Page Number Pagination</strong>: This method uses page numbers to specify which page of results to return. For example, <code>GET /items?page=2&amp;limit=10</code> would return the second page of results, with 10 items per page.</li>
<li><strong>Keyset Pagination</strong>: This method uses the values of the last item in the current page to determine the starting point for the next page. For example, if the last item on the current page has an ID of 50, the next request might be <code>GET /items?after_id=50&amp;limit=10</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="queue"><a class="header" href="#queue">Queue</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">Queue</a> it's a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, queues are often used to manage tasks, messages, or data that need to be processed asynchronously. They help in decoupling different parts of a system, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Queues use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asynchronous processing</strong>: Tasks can be added to a queue and processed by worker nodes at their own pace.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing</strong>: Distributing tasks across multiple workers to ensure no single worker is overwhelmed.</li>
<li><strong>Message brokering</strong>: Facilitating communication between different services or components in a system.</li>
<li><strong>Rate limiting</strong>: Controlling the rate at which tasks are processed to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.</li>
<li><strong>Event sourcing</strong>: Storing a sequence of events that can be processed later to reconstruct the state of a system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Issues with Queues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message loss</strong>: If a queue is not properly configured, messages may be lost during transmission or processing.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate messages</strong>: In some cases, messages may be delivered more than once, leading to redundant processing.</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Queues can introduce delays in processing, especially if they become overloaded.</li>
<li><strong>Backpressure</strong>: If the rate of incoming messages exceeds the processing capacity, it can lead to increased latency and potential message loss.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="retry"><a class="header" href="#retry">Retry</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/">Retry</a> is a technique used in distributed systems to handle transient failures by attempting an operation multiple times before giving up. This approach is particularly useful in distributed systems, where network issues or temporary unavailability of services can lead to failures that may be resolved with subsequent attempts.</p>
<h2 id="timeouts"><a class="header" href="#timeouts">Timeouts</a></h2>
<p>When implementing retries, it is important to set appropriate timeouts for each attempt. A timeout defines how long the system should wait for a response before considering the attempt a failure. Setting too short a timeout may lead to unnecessary retries, while too long a timeout can delay the overall operation.</p>
<h2 id="progressive-backoff"><a class="header" href="#progressive-backoff">Progressive Backoff</a></h2>
<p>Progressive backoff is a strategy used to increase the wait time between successive retry attempts. This approach helps to reduce the load on the system and increases the chances of success in subsequent attempts. Common backoff strategies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Backoff</strong>: A constant wait time between retries.</li>
<li><strong>Exponential Backoff</strong>: The wait time increases exponentially with each retry attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Jitter</strong>: Adding randomness to the wait time to prevent synchronized retries from multiple clients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thumdering-herd-problem"><a class="header" href="#thumdering-herd-problem">Thumdering Herd Problem</a></h2>
<p>The thundering herd problem occurs when multiple clients simultaneously retry an operation after a failure, leading to a sudden surge in requests that can overwhelm the system. To mitigate this issue, techniques such as jitter in backoff strategies and limiting the number of concurrent retries can be employed.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a> it's just a endpoint in an API or REST server. A web hook is used to notify internal/external services when certain events happen.</p>
<p>When an event occurs, the server makes an HTTP request (usually a POST request) to the specified URL of the web hook, sending relevant data about the event.</p>
<p>Web hooks are commonly used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time notifications</strong>: Informing external systems about events as they happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data synchronization</strong>: Keeping data in sync between different systems.</p>

<p>An architect does not need many tools, but for engineering than we need lots of tools. For architecture we need a couple of tools for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagramming</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Thinking</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diagraming"><a class="header" href="#diagraming">Diagraming</a></h1>
<p>Architecture must be visual, it's important to have visual diagrams. IMHO there are least 3 diagrams that are very, very useful for architects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html">Overall Architecture</a> Diagram: You can see the big pucture, you see how services talk to each other, you see the main components.</li>
<li><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/10/uml-hidden-gems.html">Class Diagram</a>: Can be useful for 2 common scenarios. A) <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2018/05/internal-system-design-forgotten.html">Internal modeling</a> of a system or B) Modeling tables in a database.</li>
<li>Sequence/state diagrams: Useful to understand how a system works internally, how data flows through the system. I would not have hundreds of theese, the goal here is not have one per UI. The goal is to have for the most important and most complex things.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best paid diagram tool is <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidCHART</a>. The best free diagram tool is <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Diagrams.net</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing"><a class="header" href="#writing">Writing</a></h1>
<p>Architects must <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/01/why-writing-matters.html">write</a>. I used a variaety of tools to write like Evernote, Grammarly, Google docs, Markdown files, MS word, and many others. Today I'm the best tool for me is Markdown files.</p>
<p>Markdown are simple and lightweight, they word with any AI Grammar tool. They are also universal and portable. IMHO I dont have the perfect writting tool ANY, I might need build mine one day but I think less is more. You need focus on your ideas, so less distractions is the key.</p>
<p>Architects needs to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles</li>
<li>Guidelines</li>
<li>Trade-offs</li>
<li>Decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>When you write something down, you are dumping ytour brain and therefore doing the same as a engineer when they fire up a PR. You are allowing other to review. Written documents scale, because many people can read, they might be forever.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="thinking"><a class="header" href="#thinking">Thinking</a></h1>
<p>An architect needs a thinking toolbox. IMHO you can use the same tool you use for <code>Diagramming</code> and <code>Writting</code>. POC's are a great laboratory for thinking as well. I used a lot of mind-maps in the past, but I find that nowadays I prefer to use plain text files with a good structure (headings, lists, code blocks, etc).</p>
<p>Markdowns can be a great tool for thinking too, but you need a diagram tool to sketch some boxes and arrows. Without coding and experimentation, thinking is just an abstract exercise. When you know the systems, and know what they can do them you can think about alternatives IMHO thinking is about exploring alternatives, exploring different trade-offs and different ways to solve or model a problem. Thinking is about being creative and open-minded.</p>
<p>There is a different when you are documenting what you solved already and that's for review or for engineers to implement. Versus thinking about how to solve a problem that is not solved yet. In the first case you are more focused on clarity and precision, in the second case you are more focused on exploration and creativity.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="in-the-end"><a class="header" href="#in-the-end">In The End</a></h1>
<p>Great song. There is no end. Being an architect it's a never ending journey. Software never stop changing, learning never stops. As a architect you must become a master student so you can become a master teacher.</p>
<p>Teaching it's all that matters, the more people know, the less bad decisions are made. The more bad decisions are avoided, the better software we all create. There is no winning without learning. The journey do not end here.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-learning"><a class="header" href="#how-to-keep-learning">How to keep learning?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Keep reading books, articles, blogs.</li>
<li>Attend conferences, meetups, webinars.</li>
<li>Teach what you learn, write articles, give talks.</li>
<li>Read code, explore open source projects.</li>
<li>Research new technologies, experiment with them.</li>
<li>Socialize with other architects, share experiences, ask for feedback.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a class="header" href="#final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2>
<p>Architecture it's hard. It's a battle it must be <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/fighting-complexity.html">fight</a> everyday. There is no done, there is not resting, so you can't do all thst without love. If you dont have love and passion for learning and teaching you can't be a good architect.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can be inspired and you can be a different person tomorrow. To create better architecture you must become a better architect. Thinking is cheap but is hard at the same time. So spead more time thinking and experimenting.</p>
<p>One last advice, do not forget about output. If you just read, that's not good enought you need put it out, so other can review, so you can see if you really know and if is really good.</p>
<p>Architecture is all about decisions, it's all about trade-offs, so you need to be sure that you are making the right decisions. The only way to be sure is to keep learning and teaching.</p>
