<p>This repository contains a curated collection of concepts, guidance about Software Architecture by Diego Pacheco.</p>
<p>I wrote this book because I have been doing software architecture for more than 20 years and I want to share my philosophy, practices, and important concepts and patterns with other architects and aspiring architects. This is also an experiment - a living piece of advice that I want to improve over time.</p>

<p>If you are an engineer, you know we are supposed to start counting at ZERO. For some reason, books always start at one, so I had to make this one start at <code>0</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rationale"><a class="header" href="#rationale">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>I wrote other books like Building Scala Applications, Principles of Software Architecture Modernisation, and Continuous Modernization. This book is on similar themes, however this is not a traditional book. It is an open source Git book. It is online and you do not need to pay.</p>
<p>The tool I am using here is very nice. It allows you to search the whole book. In any page, just type <code>/</code> on your keyboard and start typing what you want to search for. Also, because this book is written based on <code>markdown</code>, it is very easy to link any page because you have a link per page.</p>
<p>Because I am using Git, I have a history of all changes. Because this is made with software, I can update the book, so the book is versioned. Look at the footer of every page and you will see the version of the book.</p>
<p>This is a way for me to give it back. For free. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-software-architect"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-software-architect">What is a Software Architect?</a></h2>
<p>A software architect is a person that makes decisions or influences decisions about the software structure, the technologies to be used, the patterns to be followed, and the practices to be adopted. A software architect is responsible for the overall design and quality of the software system. A software architect codes, does code reviews, mentors developers, leads technical discussions, defines standards and guidelines, evaluates technologies, and ensures that the software meets the requirements and goals of the business.</p>
<p>I like to think about a software architect as a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/02/the-monk-and-rockstar.html">Monk and Rockstar</a>. An architect also goes <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/shallow-vs-deep-mindset.html">DEEP</a> in the technology, understands the details, the trade-offs, the pros and cons of different approaches. An architect also goes WIDE in the technology landscape, understands the trends, the best practices, the patterns, the anti-patterns, the tools and frameworks available.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-architecture"><a class="header" href="#what-is-architecture">What is Architecture?</a></h2>
<p>Software architecture is the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It defines the components, modules, and their interactions, as well as the principles and guidelines that govern the design and development of the software. Software architecture encompasses both the technical and non-technical aspects of the system, including performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and usability.</p>
<p>In other words, software architecture is code. But not only code, but the decision on what to do and what not to do. Software architecture is about making choices that will impact the software system in the long term.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#why-philosophy">Why Philosophy?</a></h1>
<p>Philosophy means "love of wisdom," and this project is dedicated to exploring and sharing philosophical ideas in an accessible way. The goal is to foster critical thinking, encourage open dialogue, and promote a deeper understanding of the world around us.</p>
<p>How we do things matters. There are many ways to do something wrong, but not as many ways to do it right. Philosophy is "ways of thinking," or "how to approach" problems, day-to-day life, difficult situations, decisions, and trade-offs.</p>
<p>Without a philosophy, we are likely to fall into bad habits, poor decisions, and unexamined beliefs. A well-defined philosophy helps us navigate life's complexities with clarity and purpose.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="crystal-ball"><a class="header" href="#crystal-ball">Crystal Ball</a></h1>
<p>Architects must have a good crystal ball. Requirements change, and a requirement change can break the architecture completely if it was not designed to accommodate change. Thinking ahead is a great practice because it allows you to predict the next moves, meaning you think big and ahead but execute small.</p>
<p>Code can and should be refactored. Refactoring should happen all the time and continuously. However, there are people who are allergic to refactoring, and that is a recipe for great disasters. Thinking ahead allows you to be prepared when you need it. Think about fire drills - you practice how to handle fire, so when you need it you are ready.</p>
<p>Think big execute small.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-train-your-crystal-ball-skills"><a class="header" href="#how-to-train-your-crystal-ball-skills">How to Train your Crystal Ball skills?</a></h3>
<p>One simple way is paying attention to the industry and trends. You can learn from the errors of others. Sometimes it is not that the technology or concept is bad, but people apply it wrong, and if they apply it wrong depending on the case, it can be a huge disaster like <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-death-of-microservices-distributed.html">Microservices when done wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Another form of crystal balling is to predict the next step. This one might sound harder but it is not. Let me give you 3 examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your application has a product catalog</strong>: You can start with simple exact match on the database. But if you grow and have hundreds of products, you will need Full Text Search, something like OpenSearch or ElasticSearch. You can start thinking about how to integrate that in the future. You do not need it now, but you can get familiar with it, you can search the solution space, you can even get ready. When you need it, you are much better equipped to deal with it.</li>
<li><strong>You have updates for the user</strong>: Which happen based on backend events. It is okay to use an old school polling mechanism, but if you think ahead you can start thinking about WebSockets or Server Sent Events. You can start learning how to implement that, so when you need it you are ready.</li>
<li><strong>You need to store files</strong>: You can start with a relational database and store in a table (it is an anti-pattern), but if you think ahead you can start learning how to use S3 or MinIO. You can start learning how to integrate that, so when you need it you are ready.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="defensive-programming"><a class="header" href="#defensive-programming">Defensive Programming</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">Defensive programming</a> is a design approach that emphasizes anticipating and handling potential errors or unexpected inputs in software development. For instance, you always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate inputs to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints.</li>
<li>Handle <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/09/proper-error-handling.html">exceptions gracefully</a> to prevent crashes and provide meaningful error messages.</li>
<li>Design functions and methods to be robust against invalid or unexpected inputs.</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/null-validations-and-exceptions.html">nulls</a> at all cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code should be resilient. It should not break that easily.</p>
<p>Consider the following pseudo-code with Scala 3x:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">class ProducService(
    @Autowired productRepository: ProductRepository,
    @Autowired logger: Logger
){
    def saveProduct(val product: Product, ctx: Context): Either[String, Product] = {
        val messageId = ctx.getMessageId()
        if(product.price &lt; 0){
            val errorMsg = "Product price cannot be negative"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        if (isBannedProduct(product)){
            val errorMsg = "This product is banned"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        if (!isLegalProduct(product)){
            val errorMsg = "This product is not legal in your country"
            logger.warn(s"[MessageId: $messageId] $errorMsg. Product: ${product.id}")
            return Left(s"$errorMsg [MessageId: $messageId]")
        }
        Right(productRepository.save(product))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You see that there are validations. We do not blindly trust the input. We check if the price is negative. If it is, we throw an exception. This is defensive programming in action.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="doing-hard-things"><a class="header" href="#doing-hard-things">Doing Hard Things</a></h1>
<p>Proper software is hard. It is a never-ending war. Doing the right things means teaching, socializing, influencing, enforcing, convincing, pushing back, standing your ground, and giving all sweat and blood to make the right things happen.</p>
<p>The best things in software are HARD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing the right design</li>
<li>Keeping discipline to write tests and have high diversity and coverage</li>
<li>Calling out and teaching team members about poor practices and wrong beliefs.</li>
<li>Pushing back poorly written tickets and requirements</li>
<li>Saying NO to "false shortcuts" (that lead to anti-patterns and tech debt)</li>
<li>Doing the right things every day (invisible ant work)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult thing ever is dealing with monoliths and distributed monoliths. Modernization requires a very specific and disciplined approach that is hard to do right. It requires patience, persistence, and a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>I'm convinced Distributed Monoliths are the #1 enemy of modern software architecture. Spawned across:</p>
<ul>

<p>Architects must do HARD THINGS all the time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="frontend-vs-backend"><a class="header" href="#frontend-vs-backend">Frontend VS Backend</a></h1>
<p>Frontend by nature is specific. One React component, one page, one feature. Backend by nature is generic. One API endpoint serves many features, many pages.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-thinking"><a class="header" href="#frontend-thinking">Frontend Thinking</a></h2>
<p>Tends to think 1:1. One component, one feature, one page. This might be fine for frontend but not for backend. It is common for frontend engineers to think that every single <code>fetch</code> they need to do should be a separate API endpoint (which leads to <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ConceptualIntegrity">lack of conceptual integrity</a>).</p>
<h2 id="backend-thinking"><a class="header" href="#backend-thinking">Backend Thinking</a></h2>
<p>Tends to think 1:many. One API endpoint serves many features, many pages. This might be fine for backend but not for frontend. By default, backend services should be generic and reusable.</p>
<p>It is okay to have many pages or many components, but it is not okay to have that many services. They should be generic, more centralized, and reusable by design.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="open-source-first"><a class="header" href="#open-source-first">Open Source First</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> must be the default. Avoid proprietary software. Do not build wrappers for open source libraries. Use Open Source software directly. Building internal shared libraries is a liability and will create many issues like security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden, and lack of community support / documentation. Therefore creating internal shared libraries must be a very conscious choice and must be well justified.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-important"><a class="header" href="#why-its-important">Why It's important?</a></h2>
<p>Because Open Source gives us many advantages like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is a whole community behind</strong>: Maintaining, fixing bugs, improving the performance, making it better.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: Open Source means you are not stuck with a single vendor and more likely you can run yourself or switch the vendors (this is also known as open standards like REST).</li>
<li><strong>Documentation &amp; Training</strong>: Developers often don't like to write documentation. By using open source you can get documentation for free, you get stackoverflow threads, blog posts, books, tutorials, videos and much more. Open source also means people can be trained by the market and not by you. If you have a proprietary software that only exists in your company, you cannot use the market to train people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source is also giving it back. Open source is giving visibility to engineers who do good work, open source is life and collaboration.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="service-orientation"><a class="header" href="#service-orientation">Service Orientation</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2014/11/soa-micro-services-and-isolation.html">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a> is a big deal. <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-down-on-service-orientation.html">SOA</a> should be the default way of thinking and operating services in modern software architecture. Service Orientation should be the default choice for solutions. Services are more important and better than internal libraries.</p>
<p>Services allow Isolation, Independence and Flexibility. When services are done right, with proper contracts, refactor can happen under the hood. Services allow different stacks and technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/services.html">Services</a> should be Capability oriented. Services should be as generic as possible and it's okay to have more granularity and more code in a service. Services do not need to be micro(Micro Services).</p>
<p>The most important part of services is the contract. The contract is the API. The API should be as stable as possible. The API should be backward compatible as much as possible. The API should be well documented and versioned.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/04/its-all-about-contracts.html">Contracts</a> must be well designed and reviewed carefully. It is not difficult to make <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/leaky-contracts.html">poor contracts</a> because engineers, and even more so frontend engineers, are just thinking about what needs to change, and are not thinking if it is the right place to make the change or if it should be that way at all. Contracts must be explicit and not <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/embedded-mocks-and-hidden-contracts.html">hidden</a>. The cost of refactoring a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/01/refactoring-making-sense-of-invisible.html">contract</a> is usually high, while refactoring the internal implementation is low, as long as you do not break the contract.</p>
<p>Services require a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/05/service-chain.html">lot of thinking</a>, they are not a panacea.</p>
<h2 id="soa-is-a-big-deal"><a class="header" href="#soa-is-a-big-deal">SOA is a big Deal</a></h2>
<p>Service Orientation should be the main operating model for software architecture. Services should be the default way of thinking about solutions. Services should be the default way of building solutions. Services should be the default way of operating solutions.</p>
<p>Because services allow us to have business capabilities that can be shared across different services, applications, products and use-cases. Services also allow us to isolate and have decoupling from contract and implementation (if done right), allowing the engineering team to improve things under the hood without breaking or slowing down the business.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="protect-your-time"><a class="header" href="#protect-your-time">Protect Your Time</a></h1>
<p>It is very easy to be <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/07/meetings-cost.html">consumed with meetings</a> 100% of the time. However, the architect must protect their time in order to do deep work: research, monthly reviews, crystal balling, thinking about trade-offs, evaluating solutions, and reading code.</p>
<p>At minimum, you should book at least 3 times per week for 3-6 hours to do deep work. It does not matter if it is in the morning or afternoon, whatever is easier. Hold your ground, push back, and protect that time. Architects must think.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-anti-patterns"><a class="header" href="#why-anti-patterns">Why Anti-Patterns?</a></h1>
<p>Everybody talks about patterns. Everything on the internet is "Best Practices." But people do not understand principles correctly. People think they understand when they actually do not.</p>
<p>I saw that lack of "proper application" happen over and over the years, with Agile, with Microservices, with DevOps, with Docker. If you do not understand the principles behind those "practices," you will end up doing anti-patterns.</p>
<p>Some anti-patterns are obvious and related to technology, but many anti-patterns are related to people, process, culture, and how you work as a team. Also, there are anti-patterns related to how architects behave or how they do not behave (and should behave).</p>
<p>It is important to know what is wrong, so you can avoid doing it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tech-debt-plague"><a class="header" href="#tech-debt-plague">Tech Debt Plague</a></h1>
<p>Tech debt is a <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/01/breaking-debt-cycle.html">plague</a>. It is something that all companies suffer from. It is normal to have tech debt. What is not correct is architects not fighting tech debt constantly. Tech debt must be fought all the time, either by simplifying requirements to avoid feature bloat, or by making better decisions that lead to better systems.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about this section, I was thinking in terms of <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/04/tech-debt-first.html">"Tech Debt First"</a>. Because often I see tech debt being the "default choice," which is an anti-pattern. Some technical principles should be non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Imagine you are building a house. Pretty sure the buyer does not expect the house to collapse 6 months later after buying it. To cut corners, you would not decide to use paper for walls, styrofoam for the roof, and direct sunlight for electricity. However, when we build software, bad management, bad architects, and bad developers decide to cut corners to the point of making the software collapse after a few months of being in production.</p>
<p>One classical example is skipping tests. Tests are not nice to have, they are a must have. If you do not have tests, you are building a house without a foundation. You can build it fast, but sooner or later it will collapse. How will you do refactoring without tests? Management often pushes for such bad practices, but <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/06/dont-outsmart-hard-chooses-why.html">even architects (the bad ones)</a> push for that. Tests are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>You must fight the war, <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/01/quality-needs-to-be-managed.html">manage</a> <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/06/thoughts-on-internal-complexity.html">complexity</a> by doing improvements with the engineering team every week rather than "creating a jira ticket" that will never ever be addressed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ignore-culture"><a class="header" href="#ignore-culture">Ignore Culture</a></h1>
<p>If something is wrong. Say something, do something. When you ignore problems consistently over a long period of time, you end up developing an anti-pattern, which I call "Ignore Culture".</p>
<p>When you ignore warnings in the build, when you ignore old versions of libraries, when you ignore anti-patterns on the code. When you ignore production monitoring. When you ignore requirements that make no sense.</p>
<p>Does not matter if you were the one who did the code or not. You must take ownership and under your watch you should ignore nothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/03/ignoring-culture.html">Ignoring can become a culture</a> because managers can easily do this. Engineers, often pressured by managers also can ignore several wrong things. What's wrong should not be ignored, it should be fought and pushed back.</p>
<p>Lack of fighting for what is right is immaturity. As an architect you must not ignore what's wrong. Do not let this become a culture. Ignore culture can happen so easily when people say "It's not my job", or "It's not my code" or "It's not my project" or "It's not my responsibility", the extreme lack of ownership can lead to ignore culture.</p>
<p>When you are ignoring problems you are making fertile ground for anti-patterns to grow. Tech debt plague requires ignore culture to thrive.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stagnation"><a class="header" href="#stagnation">Stagnation</a></h1>
<p>Architects must be like the Rolling Stones, they don't gather moss. Architects must be <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/11/being-active-architect.html">active</a> in a constant state of learning, always reading books, always reading papers, always reading code, always ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>If an architect stops learning, they stagnate, and stagnation is the death of architecture. Think about a coin: a coin that has no circulation is worthless. An architect that has no new knowledge cannot function and cannot be a good architect.</p>
<p>As an architect you cannot become old school. You must always be looking for new ideas, new technologies, new patterns, new anti-patterns, new ways of doing the old things. Being stuck in the past has terrible consequences. The architect is the most influential person or it should be. So what are you influencing?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h1>
<p>Mind blown by me saying <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/01/requirements-are-dangerous.html">"Requirements"</a> is an anti-pattern? Lean believes that requirements are just a decision that somebody made. Now what you need to ask yourself is, how good is this decision? Architecture is the art of making good decisions. Bad decisions COST a lot, not only money but also time, effort and frustration.</p>
<p>Architects <code>MUST</code> make good decisions. Good decisions are made when you have the right information, the right context, and the right experience. You must be prepared to make right decisions. In the beginning you will make mistakes, which is okay if you learn from them and that's why you need Architecture Review.</p>
<p>Not all requirements are anti-patterns, but seeing them as "requirements" is an anti-pattern per se. The word requirements, and often how people take it, implies that something is fixed, immutable, and unchangeable. In reality, requirements are always changing, evolving, and adapting to new circumstances. Good architects embrace change and adapt their decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>When a project starts, or when you start a task, it's very common that product did not think a lot about the consequences, trade-offs, corner cases, implications, or even what the engineering team needs to get it done. The most common anti-pattern is empty jira tickets and tons of meetings to push the "discovery work" to engineering.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with engineering collaborating with product, as long as we mark that as "Discovery work". The issue is, product pushes "not ready" tickets to development and asks: "Why is this not done yet?" then corners are cut, quality is compromised and technical debt is added. Remember the Tech Debt Plague and Ignoring culture, they are all connected.</p>
<p>You need to see requirements as "Temporary decisions", not as martial law. You need to deliver requirements, but you must challenge them, you must question them, and you must validate them. If you don't, you are just a delivery team, not an engineering team.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-dilemmas"><a class="header" href="#why-dilemmas">Why Dilemmas?</a></h1>
<p>Dilemma is a situation where a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, especially ones that are equally undesirable. Dilemmas often arise in various aspects of architecture like decision-making, and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Every single architect will face dilemmas. Some dilemmas are very common and part of any system or software development. It is important to talk about dilemmas because no one talks about them.</p>
<p>Having good perspectives allows you to make informed and balanced decisions. Consider this as a compass to navigate dilemmas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="discovery-vs-delivery"><a class="header" href="#discovery-vs-delivery">Discovery Vs Delivery</a></h1>
<p>Discovery is the moment where you are trying to figure out what to build in order to solve a problem for your users. Discovery is heavily around product and user research, prototyping, testing ideas and validating assumptions.</p>
<p>However, it's also necessary to have someone from technology doing discovery; otherwise, you transfer slowness, confusion, and risk even to be attempting to build something that is not feasible or too complex to deliver.</p>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/02/multi-track-agile-with-tta.html">Delivery</a> should be focusing on engineering, and once we know what to build (often captured as requirements and figma prototypes for the frontend) we can start building it. The question is how do I build it right. Sounds simple right? But here we have one of the biggest dilemmas in software development.</p>
<p>If you just go from discovery to delivery, you are very likely working in a waterfall fashion. So this is not linear, but (which I consider an anti-pattern) happens all the time: the moment you touch discovery, people assume discovery is done or correct, and then you only care about shipping it fast.</p>
<p>You need speed, but it's not just speed of delivery but actually speed of learning. The goal is to learn fast. Sometimes you can learn before production but often times you can only go to production to learn.</p>
<p>If you need to go to production fast to learn, should we embrace the <code>Tech Debt plague</code> and be <code>Tech Debt First</code>? No. Because you might learn what the users want or don't want, you might find what can bring revenue to the company, but the code is there (likely forever) and we need to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-roads-approach.html">balance</a> this. So you can't just <code>pick a side</code> you need to balance both sides.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="move-it-fast-or-do-it-right"><a class="header" href="#move-it-fast-or-do-it-right">Move it Fast or Do it Right?</a></h1>
<p>Facebook and silicon valley culture often emphasize speed and rapid iteration in product development. The mantra "Move Fast and Break Things" encapsulates this ethos, encouraging teams to prioritize quick delivery and innovation over meticulous planning and perfection.</p>
<p>However even Facebook admitted that they need to shift to a more balanced approach where they move fast but with stable infrastructure. It's important to do it right, in engineering, however if you build right the <code>wrong product</code>, the product people don't care, then you are wasting your time and money.</p>
<p>However it's not as simple as, then build it all fast, and all expedient, and pile up tech debt like the Tech debt plague. You will get the right product, but a poor experience, because it will be slow, full of bugs, and unreliable.</p>
<p>Again this refers to the dilemma of Discovery vs Delivery. You need to find the right balance between moving fast to discover what works and doing it right to ensure quality and reliability.</p>
<p>In theory you could "just move fast" but the issue is, lots of companies are allergic to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/11/continuous-refactoring.html">refactoring</a> and they never pay the price to improve the code. Mostly because tech leadership is bad and or immature. But either way, you need to pay the price at some point. If you never pay the price, you end up with a big ball of mud that is hard to maintain and evolve.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="build-vs-buy"><a class="header" href="#build-vs-buy">Build vs Buy</a></h1>
<p>Which one is best, build or buy? Well, it depends. Build is important when it is your core domain and is how your company makes money and differentiates from the competition. If all companies buy the same core business, how are they different? They are not.</p>
<p>However, when it is not your core business, buy makes a lot of sense because it is freeing time for you to focus on what matters: your core business. However, there is a big mistake here. There is no buy without build. Because even if you buy you will need to integrate with your existing systems. Just because you <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/proprietary-systems-and-distributed.html">buy does not mean it is perfect</a>, does not mean it fixes all your problems. It's also common when you buy a solution that same solution introduces problems that you did not have before. Buy has <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/06/software-architecture-hidden-costs.html">hidden costs</a>.</p>
<p>When buying, it's important to observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are APIs</li>
<li>Evaluate the APIs before buying</li>
<li>Buy the code (when possible)</li>
<li>Consider integration as part of the cost</li>
<li>Consider troubleshooting, debugging, observability as part of the cost</li>
</ul>
<p>If I use an AWS service vs building in-house, is it cheaper? Well, it depends where you want to put the money. In the beginning buying might sound cheaper, but you will pay AWS forever. When you build you might have a better solution (if executed right) but you now need to pay people to maintain it forever. So where do you want the money to go, your people or vendors? The question here is how good you are at execution inside the house. If your execution is terrible, go buy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decide-or-wait"><a class="header" href="#decide-or-wait">Decide or Wait</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/04/lean-deming-the-new-culture.html">Lean</a> believes that late decisions are often better than rushed ones. However, waiting too long can lead to missed opportunities. As time passes, you will be more equipped about what is best, and it is always easier to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/01/refactoring-making-sense-of-invisible.html">refactor</a> later (if the cost is not too high).</p>
<p>Decisions are a process, they should not be written in stone. Deciding something is a process, it allows us to move on. However, we should be challenging our past decisions, that is why time to reflect and think is important. Architects need to protect their time to have time to think. Engineering teams must have retrospectives to reflect on past decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is too soon to decide, you might not have data or not be sure. You must balance the cost of waiting versus the cost of deciding now. Lean has a tool to deal with this called <code>cost of delay</code>. If the cost of delay is low, you can wait more. If it is high, you must decide now.</p>
<p>Experimentation is a good way to make temporary decisions, and then figure out what sticks and what does not stick. You can try A/B testing, feature flags, or prototypes to gather data and make informed decisions later. Deciding and waiting are not mutually exclusive, they require balance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-properties"><a class="header" href="#why-properties">Why Properties?</a></h1>
<p>Properties are characteristics or attributes that define or describe an object, system, or concept. Properties give us benefits. Without architecture properties, we would be lost in a sea of ambiguity and confusion.</p>
<p>Properties are things you really want for your architecture and systems. Think about a kid, you want your son or daughter to have good properties like honesty, kindness, and respectfulness. Similarly, in architecture and systems, we want properties that ensure scalability, security, and observability.</p>
<p>Some properties are obvious, others are non-obvious. But if you know they exist, you can make explicit work to make sure they are present in your architecture and systems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="anti-fragility"><a class="header" href="#anti-fragility">Anti-Fragility</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2015/09/devops-is-about-anti-fragility-not-only.html">Anti-fragility</a> is a property of systems that not only withstand shocks and stressors but also improve and grow stronger as a result of them. Unlike resilience, which focuses on maintaining stability in the face of adversity, anti-fragile systems thrive on volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In order to achieve anti-fragility you need Defensive Programming and Chaos Engineering. You must test that your system is tolerant and can recover from failure. So you induce and provoke failure in your system and infrastructure to prove when necessary.</p>
<p>You do not want to discover in production if the system can recover from failure, you want to know beforehand. You want to know that your system is anti-fragile. Testing in production is not the same as discovering in production. Testing in production means, guard-rails and testing in production environment but without impacting real users.</p>
<p>Your systems must be anti-fragile. Your architecture must be anti-fragile. Your infrastructure must be anti-fragile. To be anti-fragile you need lots of hypotheses and experiments to prove your system is anti-fragile. Anti-fragility requires science and creativity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-develop-anti-fragile-systems"><a class="header" href="#how-to-develop-anti-fragile-systems">How to develop Anti-Fragile Systems?</a></h2>
<p>Basically we need to do 2 things. First we must test our infrastructure and systems to prove they are anti-fragile. AWS is anti-fragile by nature, but you could be using it wrong, so always a good idea to test it.</p>
<p>Second, you want to design with anti-fragility in mind. For instance we should not put all applications into a single database, we should have one database per service. Therefore we have isolation and protect against blast radius. So you see it is not just testing (which is chaos engineering) but also design with anti-fragility in mind.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state-of-the-art"><a class="header" href="#state-of-the-art">State of the Art</a></h1>
<p>If you will be building something. Why start with something deprecated? Why not use the latest versions? State of the art is not about just using the latest and greatest versions but also picking the best solutions.</p>
<p>Why not pick the best database? why not pick the best language? why not pick the best framework? why not pick the best architecture?</p>
<p>We should be creating the best architecture and the best solutions, just going with the "standards" is a path to stagnation.</p>
<p>This might sound impossible, but it's not. It just requires more research and more effort. But is 100% doable and should be done.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scalability"><a class="header" href="#scalability">Scalability</a></h1>
<p>A good architect produces good architecture. Architecture is embedded in code. Good code is scalable code.</p>
<p>Scalability is not only for systems, it's also for engineering teams. A good architecture allows teams to work in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.</p>
<p>Good structure, good design, allow engineers to be more productive, and focus on delivering value, instead of fighting with the codebase. You want the architectures you produce to have these properties.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="observable"><a class="header" href="#observable">Observable</a></h1>
<p>As an architect, the systems you produce must have the ability to be observable. Such property is very important. Consider <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/observability-domain-observability-from.html">observability</a> a subset of <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/02/going-faster-with-testing.html">testing</a> which happens in production.</p>
<p>If you do not know what is going on, you are driving in the dark. You want to be able to understand how your system behaves in production, and be able to detect issues before they become problems for your users.</p>
<p>Without such understanding, you are not doing the whole cycle correctly. Building something following a design is not enough. You need to observe the final product in production, and be able to learn from it and improve it.</p>
<p>Making Observable systems implies having:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper Logging</li>
<li>Exposing custom application metrics</li>
<li>Latency distribution metrics for upstream and downstream dependencies</li>
<li>Proper Message IDs</li>
<li>The practice of looking at production monitoring dashboards and logs as part of your daily routine and retrofitting the learnings to the engineering team</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stability"><a class="header" href="#stability">Stability</a></h1>
<p>Not only your architecture but your systems must be stable. Being <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-stability-mindset.html">stable is a state</a>, which means they are not broken all the time. Systems should not be broken. It's impossible to never break the system, after all we are only humans. However this is not an excuse for lack of attention, carelessness or poor practices.</p>
<p>A stable system is one where most of the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build is passing</li>
<li>Tests are passing, in all environments</li>
<li>Deployments are successful</li>
<li>Monitoring shows healthy metrics in production</li>
<li>Tech debt is being managed</li>
</ul>
<p>A stable architecture is one where:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reason about concepts with confidence</li>
<li>You can make changes without breaking things</li>
<li>You can onboard new team members without much friction</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="secure"><a class="header" href="#secure">Secure</a></h1>
<p>Software must be secure. Architects should prioritize security in their designs to protect data and maintain user trust. Lack of security ruins brands, trust is damaged, and legal consequences may arise.</p>
<p>Security means implementing measures to protect systems from threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. This includes practices like <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/11/why-encryption-is-so-hard.html">encryption</a>, authentication, authorization, <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/tokenization-encryption-and.html">tokenization</a>, <a href="https://blog.algomaster.io/p/securely-storing-passwords-in-a-database">passwords</a> where the best way to deal with them is to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html">not have credentials</a>, and regular security audits.</p>
<p>Common considerations for secure architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Protection</strong>: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Keep software and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects need to know security. Architecture must be designed with security in mind from the outset, rather than being an afterthought. This includes threat modeling, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring for potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>By prioritizing security in software architecture, organizations can safeguard their systems, protect user data, and maintain trust with their users.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-to-leak"><a class="header" href="#nothing-to-leak">Nothing to Leak</a></h2>
<p>If you have sensitive information, therefore it can be leaked. Unless you do not have it. For instance, there is a variety of tools and solutions that make you "not have secrets." If you do not have secrets:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't leak them</li>
<li>You don't need rotate them</li>
<li>You don't need to worry</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of "Nothing to Leak" solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html">AWS RDS IAM Authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS KMS</a></li>
<li>Not valid to all applications - but - not storing OPEN_API_KEY</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-you-have-credentials"><a class="header" href="#when-you-have-credentials">When you have Credentials</a></h2>
<p>You need a lot of work to make sure they are secure. For each credential or key you have, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate them periodically</li>
<li>Store them securely (eg: secrets manager, AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, etc)</li>
<li>Audit their usage</li>
<li>Monitor for leaks (eg: <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>)</li>
<li>Limit their access (eg: least privilege principle) - for keys (called key scoping)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gitops-is-sexy-for-security"><a class="header" href="#gitops-is-sexy-for-security">GitOPS is Sexy for Security</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/">GitOps</a> is a practice that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. By leveraging GitOps, organizations can enhance security.</p>
<p>The core idea with GitOps is that you do not give <code>admin</code> or super <code>privileges IAM roles</code> to developers. Instead, you have a system that applies changes based on approvals. For GitOps, such approvals come from Pull Requests that are merged. You have a history of all changes and can walk back in time thanks to Git.</p>
<p>GitOps is perfect for security because you reduce the blast radius of "sharing credentials".</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-practices"><a class="header" href="#why-practices">Why Practices?</a></h1>
<p>Architecture is not just about technology. Architecture is also about people, and what and how you work with the team.</p>
<p>The way you work matters, what you do and what you do not do (consciously) also matter.</p>
<p>Practices are about "how you do things," the way you approach problems, day-to-day life, difficult situations, decisions, and trade-offs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attention-to-detail"><a class="header" href="#attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</a></h1>
<p>Architects must be meticulous in their work, ensuring that every aspect of a design is carefully considered and executed. <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/10/its-all-about-attention.html">Attention to detail</a> is crucial for creating functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing structures. Here are some key areas where attention to detail is essential.</p>
<p>Architects pay close attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code: Classes, Internal design, contracts, patterns/anti-patterns</li>
<li>Tests: Are they passing?, how good they are? do we have good diversity? coverage?</li>
<li>Production Logs: Are there any errors? warnings? anomalies?</li>
<li>Production Dashboards: Are all metrics within expected ranges?</li>
<li>Error Tracking: Are there any new issues? recurring issues? We should have ZERO EXCEPTIONS.</li>
<li>Performance Metrics: Are we meeting our performance goals? any regressions?</li>
<li>Security Audits: Are there any vulnerabilities? are we compliant with security standards?</li>
<li>Requirements: Are we meeting all specified requirements? any missing features?</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects are critical and detail-oriented when it comes to every single tech detail.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="architecture-review"><a class="header" href="#architecture-review">Architecture Review</a></h1>
<p>If you don't have anything written, how can we review it? How can you communicate with the engineering team? How can you onboard new team members?</p>
<p>Architecture must be written down, at the minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall Architecture Diagram</li>
<li>Key Decisions (with rationale)</li>
<li>Important <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/07/tradeoffs.html">Trade-offs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Arch documentation can be done with a markdown file, here is a good template: https://github.com/diegopacheco/tech-resources/blob/master/arch-doc-template.md</p>
<p>When you write down, principles, decisions, guidance, and trade-offs become explicit, easier to communicate, and easier to review. Diagrams help a lot, especially overall architecture diagrams and class diagrams, which are very useful.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="design-first"><a class="header" href="#design-first">Design First</a></h1>
<p>Architects must think. They must produce the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/04/design-is-not-subjective.html">design</a> before the implementation. However, that's only possible if the architect masters the problem domain and the technology being used. If that does not happen, Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are a great way to explore the problem and the technology before the design is produced.</p>
<p>Writing down the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html">design</a> is also a great way to communicate it to the team and get feedback. The <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/design-101.html">design</a> should be a living document that evolves with the project. If you jump into executing all the time you are doing just tactical programming (Philosophy of software design).</p>
<p>If you move before you think, tech debt will happen, bad decisions will happen.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ownership"><a class="header" href="#ownership">Ownership</a></h1>
<p>Architects must have <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/11/expectations.html">extreme ownership</a>. They are responsible for the success and failure of the architecture they design. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the architecture meets business requirements.</li>
<li>Continuously evaluating and improving the architecture.</li>
<li>Collaborating with development teams to ensure proper implementation.</li>
<li>Staying updated with industry trends and best practices.</li>
<li>Documenting architectural decisions and their rationale.</li>
<li>Advocating for the architecture within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architects must be proactive. Architects are always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking: Thinking ahead about future changes and how the architecture can accommodate them.</li>
<li>Performing Research: Researching new technologies and patterns that can improve the architecture.</li>
<li>Socializing: Effectively communicating, educating, and influencing stakeholders to ensure alignment and understanding of the architecture.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reading-code"><a class="header" href="#reading-code">Reading Code</a></h1>
<p>I know this might sound silly. But Architects need to <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/training-like-pros.html">read the code</a>, they should go download the code and read it. Not only read it but <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/code-analysis-at-scale.html">analyze</a> it. Reading the code allow the architect to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the complexity of the system</li>
<li>See the anti-patterns on the code</li>
<li>Understand what the system does</li>
</ul>
<p>Many meetings can be saved if people just read the code. Architects must be Hackers, they need to read the code. Read the system code, read the libraries code, read the frameworks code. Reading code is not a one-time thing; it's an everyday thing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monthly-review"><a class="header" href="#monthly-review">Monthly Review</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2019/11/getting-best-out-github-with-remote.html">Code review</a> is great. Architects should do <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2018/07/lessons-learned-and-experiences-doing.html">Code review</a>. However code review is pretty much focused on deltas. Which is not the whole story.</p>
<p>Code review happens in-cycle, meaning every week, every day, or pretty much every time a ticket/PR is done. We also need an off-cycle review.</p>
<p>As an architect, 1x per month or at least 1x per quarter you should look at the whole codebase. Why? Because then you are not looking at the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/beyond-code-deltas.html">deltas</a>, you are looking at the whole picture and seeing the <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2011/04/team-code-review-design-sessions.html">design</a>.</p>
<p>Such practice is important to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural concept drift: Are we still following the intended architecture? Are there parts of the code that have diverged from the original design principles?</li>
<li>Code quality trends: Is the overall code quality improving or deteriorating? Are there areas that need refactoring or technical debt reduction?</li>
<li>Consistency: Are coding standards and best practices being followed consistently across the codebase?</li>
<li>New patterns and anti-patterns: Are there new design patterns emerging that could be beneficial? Are there anti-patterns that need to be addressed?</li>
<li>Testing Diversity: Is the test coverage adequate? Are there areas that lack sufficient testing? Do we need new forms of testing and induction?</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="working-on-trenches"><a class="header" href="#working-on-trenches">Working on Trenches</a></h1>
<p>Lean has this principle of "Gemba" which means "the real place" in Japanese. It emphasizes the importance of going to the actual place where work is done to understand processes and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>Software is a war that never ends. Architects need to be on the battle front, on the trenches with engineers. Architects should not fix all the problems and code all the stories. However they need to code, they need to help the team to deal with complex problems. Architects going there and helping the team is a way to prevent a timeline disruption. Otherwise what <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/02/architects-as-gatekeepers.html">kind of architect</a> are you?</p>
<p>Architects on the frontend line is also how they can understand the real problems the team is facing. Architects cannot be hands off.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-concepts"><a class="header" href="#why-concepts">Why Concepts?</a></h1>
<p>Without knowing key concepts, you did not really learn something properly. Knowing concepts allows you to build mental models that help you understand new information faster and better.</p>
<p>Without mental models, you are just memorizing information, and that is not a good way to learn and the worst way to operate. Mental models can only be built with proper understanding of concepts.</p>
<p>Having good mental models is a game changer, because it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn new things faster</li>
<li>Understand complex topics better</li>
<li>Make better decisions</li>
<li>Solve problems more effectively</li>
<li>Communicate ideas clearly</li>

<p>Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining all predefined rules, such as constraints, cascades, and triggers.</p>
<h2 id="i--isolation"><a class="header" href="#i--isolation">I == Isolation</a></h2>
<p>Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.</p>
<p>This prevents transactions from reading uncommitted data from other transactions, which could lead to inconsistencies.</p>
<h2 id="d--durability"><a class="header" href="#d--durability">D == Durability</a></h2>
<p>Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. Committed data is saved to non-volatile storage, ensuring that it is not lost. Usually using a WAL (Write Ahead Log) to achieve this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle are ACID.</li>
<li>Non-relational databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra or Redis are not ACID.</li>
<li>knowing that your database has ACID properties allow you to design simple systems because you can rely on ACID properties.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's say you want write a system where only one user can rent a car. You probably can think in some complex solution with locks. However you don't need that because you simply can rely on the ACID properties. If two users try to insert the rental at same time, one will succeed and the other will fail. So ACID allow your code to be simple.</p>

<h2 id="authentication"><a class="header" href="#authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">Authentication</a> is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. Common methods of authentication include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords (very bad)</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>
<li>Biometric verification</li>
<li>OAuth tokens</li>
<li>API keys</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="authorization"><a class="header" href="#authorization">Authorization</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization">Authorization</a> is the process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It defines the permissions and access levels for different resources. Common authorization models include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</li>
<li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li>
<li>IAM (Identity and Access Management) systems</li>
<li>Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)</li>
<li>Policy as Code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entitlements"><a class="header" href="#entitlements">Entitlements</a></h2>
<p>Entitlements refer to the specific rights or privileges granted to a user or system after authentication and authorization. They define what actions can be performed on specific resources. Examples of entitlements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access a product catalog (invisible by default)</li>
<li>See premium content</li>
<li>See premium features</li>
</ul>

<li>Internal services don't require any authentication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Authorization</p>
<ol>
<li>It's the next step after authorization.</li>
<li>In security we can give granular access to resources. This principle is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">least privilege</a>.</li>
<li>Authonrization is checking if the user has the fine grained access to a resource.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="base"><a class="header" href="#base">BASE</a></h1>
<p>A concept from NoSQL databases.
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-acid-and-base-database/">BASE</a> systems prioritize availability instead of immediate consistency.</p>
<h2 id="base-properties"><a class="header" href="#base-properties">BASE Properties</a></h2>
<p>BASE is an acronym that describes the consistency model used by many NoSQL systems. It stands for:</p>
<h3 id="ba--basically-available"><a class="header" href="#ba--basically-available">BA == Basically Available</a></h3>
<p>The system guarantees availability - it will always respond to requests, even if the response contains stale or inconsistent data. The database remains operational even when parts of the system fail.</p>
<h3 id="s--soft-state"><a class="header" href="#s--soft-state">S == Soft state</a></h3>
<p>The state of the system may change over time, even without new input, due to eventual consistency. Data doesn't have to be immediately consistent across all nodes.</p>
<h3 id="e--eventual-consistency"><a class="header" href="#e--eventual-consistency">E == Eventual consistency</a></h3>
<p>Given enough time without new updates, all replicas will eventually converge to the same value. The system doesn't guarantee immediate consistency but promises that consistency will be achieved eventually.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-2"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-2">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>NoSQL databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis are often BASE. By understanding BASE properties you can better understand what to expect from your NoSQL database. For instance knowing you have a BASE set of properties in place means that if you insert some data, or update some data, you might not see that replicated across all nodes immediately. Eventually it will be all consistent across all nodes.</p>
<p>This might sound silly but affects the user experience to the sense that you will not have immediate effect of anything. In a Sync/Blocking universe everything is immediate, but you might think that is better? Well for humans might be but for systems it sucks and it is much harder to scale. In AWS everything is Async and Non-Blocking.</p>
<p>Do not believe me? Watch this keynote from AWS re:Invent 2022 where Dr. Werner Vogels (CTO of AWS) explains this concept in detail around the 1 hour mark.</p>

PS: I was there in Vegas and saw that live, was pretty awesome.<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="idempotency"><a class="header" href="#idempotency">Idempotency</a></h1>
<p>It is an interesting property that allows the same operation to be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.</p>
<p>In REST APIs, idempotency is an important concept, especially for HTTP methods. Common idempotent HTTP methods include GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PUT.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GET</strong>: The most famous and common idempotent method. Retrieving a resource multiple times does not change its state.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Idempotency</a> is important because if the same request arrives twice (there are no side effects), the server can safely ignore the second request or return the same result as the first one without any unintended consequences, or just re-process the same thing again without issues.</p>
<p>Such principle keeps us from writing complex software. For instance, if a GET operation also does inserts and deletes, we would have to handle the case where the same GET request is sent multiple times, which could lead to data inconsistency and unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>So we want to honor the idempotency principle to keep our software simple and predictable.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-3"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-3">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>When you are designing and implementing REST APIS. Which pretty much is the bread and butter of all backend development now a days. You must guarantee that your GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE and PUT methods are idempotent. This is not a merely rule of thumb, is a must. Because your consumers/clients will expect that behavior from your API. If you break that expectation, you will have a bad time debugging and fixing issues that could be easily avoided by following the idempotency principle.</p>
<p>Secondly IF you break idempotency you will have more complex code to maintain. Because you will have to handle edge cases and weired things, it will be harder to test, everything will be worse. So just follow the principle and keep your code simple.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking"><a class="header" href="#pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking">Pessimistic vs Optimistic Locking</a></h1>
<p>When dealing with concurrent access to shared resources, two primary locking strategies can be employed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">pessimistic locking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic locking</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pessimistic locking</strong>: assumes that conflicts will occur and therefore locks the resource for exclusive access when a transaction begins. This approach is suitable for environments with high contention, as it prevents other transactions from modifying the resource until the lock is released. However, it can lead to reduced concurrency and potential deadlocks.</p>
<p><strong>Optimistic locking</strong>: assumes that conflicts are rare and allows multiple transactions to access the resource concurrently. Instead of locking the resource, it checks for conflicts only when a transaction attempts to commit changes. If a conflict is detected, the transaction is rolled back and can be retried. This approach is more efficient in low-contention environments, as it maximizes concurrency and minimizes locking overhead.</p>
<p>Optimistic locking is often implemented using versioning, where each resource has a version number that is checked and updated during transactions. If the version number has changed since the transaction began, it indicates a conflict.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-4"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-4">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the differences between pessimistic and optimistic locking is crucial for designing systems that handle concurrent access to shared resources effectively. Choosing the right locking strategy can significantly impact system performance, scalability, and user experience.</p>
<p>Pessimits locking is better when:</p>
<ul>
<li>High contention for resources is expected.</li>
<li>The cost of rolling back transactions is high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimistic locking is better when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contention for resources is low.</li>
<li>The cost of rolling back transactions is low.</li>
<li>High concurrency is desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very appealing to just use optimistic locking everywhere. However there are scenatios where you should have none. For instance, you classical example. It's an anti-pattern but happen a lot, React applications on the frontend might not be fully tested and might have many re-renderings causing many requests to be sent to the bbackend. In such scenario optimistic locking can cause a lot of pain and will be unnecessary overhead. In such scenario, just do nothing and rely on last write wins strategy or just pig bank on ACID properties.</p>
<p>Ofcourse it really dependends on what the application does and the criticallity of the transaction. But the React scenario is not hypothetical, I've seen it happen many times in real life. Also if the frontend did not implement a time based debounce mechanism, the user might have a nervous finger and click multiple times on a button causing multiple requests to be sent to the backend. In such scenario optimistic locking will just add unnecessary pain and false positives.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="partition"><a class="header" href="#partition">Partition</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>partition</strong> of a set is a way of dividing the data set into subsets such that every element in the original set is included in exactly one of the subsets. In other words, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(database)">partition</a> breaks down a set into distinct parts where no part shares any elements with another, and all parts together cover the entire original set.</p>
<p>Partition by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific column or set of columns</li>
<li>A specific number of partitions</li>
<li>A specific size of each partition</li>
<li>A specific percentage of data in each partition</li>
<li>A specific condition or rule</li>
<li>A random distribution of data into partitions</li>
<li>Consistent hashing for distributed systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Partitions matter because they can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of data processing tasks. Proper partitioning can lead to faster query execution, reduced data shuffling, and improved resource utilization in distributed computing environments.</p>
<p>When designing partitions, consider factors such as data distribution, query patterns, and the underlying storage system to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-5"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-5">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>When you don't have a lot of data you can 100% survive without partitions. But as your data grows, partitions become crucial for maintaining performance and scalability. Proper partitioning can help you manage large datasets more effectively, improve query performance, and optimize resource usage.</p>
<p>Partitions are a MUST at Scale. Another scenario you want partition is when the data grows quickly, like a lot of data everyday, recurent batch jogs getting data non-stop. If you just updating data in place you are fine, but if you keep inserting data without partitions, you will quickly run into performance issues as the dataset grows larger.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="schema-evolution"><a class="header" href="#schema-evolution">Schema Evolution</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution">Schema evolution</a> is the practice of changing data structures, API contracts, or message formats over time while maintaining compatibility with existing clients and services. This is critical for zero-downtime deployments in distributed systems.</p>
<h2 id="forward-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#forward-compatibility">Forward Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Forward compatibility means that old code can read data written by new code. The old system can safely ignore new fields it doesn't understand.</p>
<p>When adding new fields to a schema:</p>
<ul>
<li>New fields should be optional with sensible defaults</li>
<li>Old services can process new messages by ignoring unknown fields</li>
<li>Allows deploying new producers before updating consumers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Backward compatibility means that new code can read data written by old code. The new system must handle the absence of fields that didn't exist in older versions.</p>
<p>When reading old data:</p>
<ul>
<li>New code must provide defaults for missing fields</li>
<li>New services can process old messages correctly</li>
<li>Allows deploying new consumers before updating producers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breaking-changes"><a class="header" href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</a></h2>
<p>Breaking changes destroy compatibility and require coordinated deployments. Avoid these whenever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing required fields</li>
<li>Changing field types</li>
<li>Renaming fields without aliasing</li>
<li>Changing field semantics</li>
<li>Making optional fields required</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safe-schema-changes"><a class="header" href="#safe-schema-changes">Safe Schema Changes</a></h2>
<p>Safe changes maintain compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding optional fields with defaults</li>
<li>Removing optional fields</li>
<li>Adding new enum values at the end</li>
<li>Adding new message types</li>
<li>Deprecating fields instead of removing them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="versioning-strategies"><a class="header" href="#versioning-strategies">Versioning Strategies</a></h2>
<p><strong>URL Versioning</strong>: Different versions in the URL path like <code>/api/v1/users</code> and <code>/api/v2/users</code></p>
<p><strong>Header Versioning</strong>: Version specified in request headers like <code>Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json</code></p>
<p><strong>Content Negotiation</strong>: Different media types for different versions</p>
<p><strong>No Versioning</strong>: Evolve schema compatibly without explicit versions. Requires discipline but provides best flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="migration-strategies"><a class="header" href="#migration-strategies">Migration Strategies</a></h2>
<p><strong>Expand-Contract Pattern</strong>: Three-phase deployment for breaking changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand: Add new field alongside old field</li>
<li>Migrate: Update all services to use new field</li>
<li>Contract: Remove old field after migration complete</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shadow Reading</strong>: New code reads both old and new formats, writes only new format</p>
<p><strong>Feature Flags</strong>: Toggle between old and new behavior at runtime</p>
<h2 id="database-schema-evolution"><a class="header" href="#database-schema-evolution">Database Schema Evolution</a></h2>
<p>Database schemas require special care because data persists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use migrations that can run without downtime</li>
<li>Add columns as nullable first, backfill data, then make required</li>
<li>Drop columns in separate deployment after code stops using them</li>
<li>Use views or aliases to maintain old column names during transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Schema evolution is not optional in production systems. Every change must consider compatibility to avoid outages during deployments.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-6"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-6">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>All backend systems have databases. Backend systems should never share database access with other services. We need mantain and evolve database schemas without breaking existing application. By following good schema evolution patterns we can ensure smooth deployments and maintain system reliability.</p>
<p>Backward compability is more important than forward compatibility in most backend systems, because backend systems are the source of truth for data. Also if you need rolback the code on the application for a bug or some mistake, our the business just change theier minds, you can do that easily without breaking the database. If you smart enought you might be able to scape database migrations in some cases even.</p>
<p>Forward compatibility is more important in event-driven systems, where multiple services consume the same events. In this case, you want to make sure that old services can still process new events without issues.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="source-of-truth"><a class="header" href="#source-of-truth">Source of Truth</a></h1>
<p>It is a concept that means what database or system is considered the authoritative source for a particular piece of information. It is common in distributed systems to have multiple databases or even systems that store the same data. In such cases, it is crucial to designate one of these as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">"source of truth"</a> to ensure consistency and reliability of the data across the entire system.</p>
<p>The same concept is used in migrations. While you are migrating from System A to System B, System A is the source of truth until the migration is complete and verified. After that, System B becomes the new source of truth.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-7"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-7">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>In distributed systems, having a clear source of truth is essential to avoid data inconsistencies and conflicts. When multiple services or databases can modify the same data, it can lead to situations where different parts of the system have different versions of the truth. This can cause errors, confusion, and data integrity issues.</p>
<p>It's common to have one system or one database behind a service to be the Source of Truth. This also means that a bunch of systems can READ or have a COPY of the data, usually in a form of a CACHE to have performance benefits, but when regards of where to WRITE must be a clear and only one place.</p>
<p>This might sound silly, but this can either bring great sanity or a big mess to your system. Always make sure you have a clear Source of Truth for your data.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stateless-vs-stateful-services"><a class="header" href="#stateless-vs-stateful-services">Stateless vs Stateful Services</a></h1>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_statelessness_principle">designing services</a>, one of the key architectural decisions is whether to implement them as stateless or stateful. <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2024/12/state.html">State</a> is a big thing. Stateless services do not retain any information about previous interactions, while stateful services maintain state information across multiple requests.</p>
<p>It is much easier to work with stateless services because they can scale more easily, recover from failures faster, and are generally simpler to manage. However, there are scenarios where stateful services are necessary, such as when maintaining user sessions or handling transactions.</p>
<p>Stateless does not mean that the service cannot use state at all; rather, it means that the service itself does not store state between requests. Instead, any necessary state can be stored in external systems like databases or caches. Stateful services are more complex.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-to-know-this-8"><a class="header" href="#why-you-need-to-know-this-8">Why you need to know this?</a></h2>
<p>As much as possible try to create services as stateless. This will bring you a lot of benefits in terms of scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Most importantly it will be much easier to reason, maintain and evolve your services over time.</p>
<p>When you need to create stateful services, be very careful about how you manage state. Consider using external systems to store state information and ensure that your services can handle failures gracefully. Always evaluate the trade-offs between stateless and stateful designs based on your specific use case and requirements.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-patterns"><a class="header" href="#why-patterns">Why Patterns?</a></h1>

<p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Primarily focuses on managing and routing API requests. It handles tasks such as request transformation, response aggregation, authentication, and rate limiting. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load Balancer</strong>: Primarily focuses on distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability. It operates at both the transport layer (Layer 4) and application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, depending on the type of load balancer used.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/bff-dilema.html">Backend for Frontend (BFF)</a> pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored to the specific needs of different frontend applications. Usually written in a language that is common for the frontend team, meaning: NodeJS with JS or TypeScript.</p>
<p>BFFs should have <code>Rendering Logic</code> and should NEVER have <code>Business Logic</code> because that should be encapsulated in the core backend services.</p>
<h2 id="bffs-are"><a class="header" href="#bffs-are">BFFs Are</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="connection-pool"><a class="header" href="#connection-pool">Connection Pool</a></h1>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool">connection pool</a> is a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required. Connection pools are used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database. Opening and maintaining a database connection for each user, especially requests made to a dynamic database-driven website application, is costly and wastes resources.</p>
<p>It's expensive to open and close connections to the database all the time. That's why these objects are created at application startup and they are borrowed and returned to the pool as needed.</p>
<p>Java has a great connection pooling libraries like HikariCP.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="feature-flags"><a class="header" href="#feature-flags">Feature Flags</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">Feature flags</a> are runtime configuration switches that enable or disable functionality without deploying new code. They decouple deployment from release, allowing gradual rollouts and instant rollbacks, migrations and A/B testing.</p>
<h2 id="strategies"><a class="header" href="#strategies">Strategies</a></h2>
<p><strong>Environment Variables</strong>: Simplest approach. Requires restart to change. Good for operational flags.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration Files</strong>: Load from files on startup or reload periodically. No restart needed if hot-reloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Database or Cache</strong>: Dynamic flags stored in database or distributed cache. Change instantly across all instances.</p>
<p><strong>Feature Flag Services</strong>: Dedicated systems like LaunchDarkly, Split, or Unleash. Advanced targeting and analytics.</p>
<h2 id="targeting-and-segmentation"><a class="header" href="#targeting-and-segmentation">Targeting and Segmentation</a></h2>
<p>Flags can target based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>User ID or email for specific users</li>
<li>Percentage rollout for gradual releases</li>
<li>Geographic region or data center</li>
<li>User attributes like subscription tier</li>
<li>Environment like staging vs production</li>
<li>Random sampling for experiments</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anti-patterns"><a class="header" href="#anti-patterns">Anti-Patterns</a></h2>
<p><strong>Long-Lived Release Flags</strong>: Release flags should be temporary. Remove after release complete.</p>
<p><strong>Nested Flags</strong>: Flags inside flags create exponential complexity. Avoid deeply nested conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Flag Proliferation</strong>: Too many flags make system hard to reason about. Be selective.</p>
<p><strong>Using Flags for Configuration</strong>: Feature flags are not general configuration. Use proper config systems for that.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="load-balancer"><a class="header" href="#load-balancer">Load Balancer</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">LB</a> is a service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving application availability and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Load balancers can operate at different layers of the OSI model, such as Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7 (Application Layer), providing various features like SSL termination, session persistence, and health monitoring of backend servers.</p>
<h2 id="common-load-balancing-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#common-load-balancing-algorithms">Common Load Balancing Algorithms</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: Distributes requests sequentially across the servers.</li>
<li><strong>Least Connections</strong>: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.</li>
<li><strong>IP Hash</strong>: Uses the client's IP address to determine which server will handle the request.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong>: Similar to Round Robin but allows assigning weights to servers based on their capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Random</strong>: Distributes requests randomly across the servers.</li>
<li><strong>Metric-Based</strong>: Uses specific metrics (like response time or server load) to make load balancing decisions.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="message-patterns"><a class="header" href="#message-patterns">Message Patterns</a></h1>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern">different</a> ways to structure message communication between systems.</p>
<h2 id="publishsubscribe-pattern"><a class="header" href="#publishsubscribe-pattern">Publish/Subscribe Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Publishers send messages to a topic or channel without knowing who will receive them. Subscribers express interest in specific topics and receive all messages published to those topics.</p>
<p>Pub/Sub Nature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-to-Many</strong>: A single message can be delivered to multiple subscribers.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: Publishers and subscribers don't need to know about each other.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Subscription</strong>: Subscribers can join or leave at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Topic-Based</strong>: Messages are organized by topics or channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pub/Sub Use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time notifications across multiple services</li>
<li>Event-driven architectures where multiple consumers need the same data</li>
<li>Log aggregation and monitoring systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="point-to-point-pattern"><a class="header" href="#point-to-point-pattern">Point-to-Point Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Messages are sent directly from one sender to one specific receiver. Messages are typically placed in a queue where they are consumed by a single consumer.</p>
<p>P2P:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-to-One</strong>: Each message is consumed by exactly one receiver.</li>
<li><strong>Message Ordering</strong>: Messages are typically processed in the order they arrive.</li>
<li><strong>Load Distribution</strong>: Multiple consumers can read from the same queue for load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Delivery</strong>: Messages remain in the queue until successfully processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>P2P Use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task distribution among worker nodes</li>
<li>Request-response communication between services</li>
<li>Sequential processing of transactions</li>
<li>Background job processing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="request-reply-pattern"><a class="header" href="#request-reply-pattern">Request-Reply Pattern</a></h2>
<p>A pattern where a sender sends a message and waits for a response from the receiver. The sender includes a reply-to address in the message so the receiver knows where to send the response.
This pattern combines aspects of both synchronous and asynchronous communication, allowing for non-blocking request-response interactions.</p>
<h2 id="message-ordering"><a class="header" href="#message-ordering">Message Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Message ordering guarantees vary by pattern and implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIFO Ordering</strong>: Messages are processed in the order they are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Partition Ordering</strong>: Messages within the same partition maintain order.</li>
<li><strong>No Ordering</strong>: Messages may be processed in any order for maximum throughput.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="message-id"><a class="header" href="#message-id">Message Id</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID">Message ID</a> Also known as CORRELATION_ID. The idea that each message or request must have a unique id, and you will pass down such id into the downstream services. Via headers or other means. When you log anything you also log the MESSAGE_ID.</p>
<p>Why this is important?</p>
<ul>
<li>Traceability: When you have a unique MESSAGE_ID for each request, you can trace the entire lifecycle of that request across multiple services. This is especially useful in microservices architectures where a single user action may trigger multiple service calls.</li>
<li>Debugging: If an error occurs, having a MESSAGE_ID allows you to quickly locate all logs and events related to that specific request. This can significantly speed up the debugging process.</li>
<li>Monitoring: MESSAGE_IDs can be used to monitor the performance of requests as they pass through different services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a MESSAGE_ID, it becomes impossible to debug distributed systems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pagination"><a class="header" href="#pagination">Pagination</a></h1>
<p>When you have an endpoint that returns a large list of items, it is often useful to <a href="https://www.merge.dev/blog/rest-api-pagination">paginate</a> the results. This means breaking the results into smaller chunks, or "pages", that can be retrieved one at a time.</p>
<p>Basic benefit here is to reduce the amount of data transferred in a single request, which can improve performance and reduce load on the server. Less latency and more responsive applications are the end result.</p>
<h2 id="pagination-strategies"><a class="header" href="#pagination-strategies">Pagination Strategies</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offset-Based Pagination</strong>: This is the most common method, where the client specifies an offset (the starting point) and a limit (the number of items to return). For example, <code>GET /items?offset=20&amp;limit=10</code> would return items 21-30.</li>
<li><strong>Cursor-Based Pagination</strong>: Instead of using an offset, this method uses a cursor (a unique identifier for a specific item) to mark the starting point for the next page of results. For example, <code>GET /items?cursor=abc123&amp;limit=10</code> would return the next 10 items after the item with the cursor <code>abc123</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Page Number Pagination</strong>: This method uses page numbers to specify which page of results to return. For example, <code>GET /items?page=2&amp;limit=10</code> would return the second page of results, with 10 items per page.</li>
<li><strong>Keyset Pagination</strong>: This method uses the values of the last item in the current page to determine the starting point for the next page. For example, if the last item on the current page has an ID of 50, the next request might be <code>GET /items?after_id=50&amp;limit=10</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="queue"><a class="header" href="#queue">Queue</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">Queue</a> is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, queues are often used to manage tasks, messages, or data that need to be processed asynchronously. They help in decoupling different parts of a system, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Queues use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asynchronous processing</strong>: Tasks can be added to a queue and processed by worker nodes at their own pace.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing</strong>: Distributing tasks across multiple workers to ensure no single worker is overwhelmed.</li>
<li><strong>Message brokering</strong>: Facilitating communication between different services or components in a system.</li>
<li><strong>Rate limiting</strong>: Controlling the rate at which tasks are processed to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.</li>
<li><strong>Event sourcing</strong>: Storing a sequence of events that can be processed later to reconstruct the state of a system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Issues with Queues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message loss</strong>: If a queue is not properly configured, messages may be lost during transmission or processing.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate messages</strong>: In some cases, messages may be delivered more than once, leading to redundant processing.</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Queues can introduce delays in processing, especially if they become overloaded.</li>
<li><strong>Backpressure</strong>: If the rate of incoming messages exceeds the processing capacity, it can lead to increased latency and potential message loss.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="retry"><a class="header" href="#retry">Retry</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/">Retry</a> is a technique used in distributed systems to handle transient failures by attempting an operation multiple times before giving up. This approach is particularly useful in distributed systems, where network issues or temporary unavailability of services can lead to failures that may be resolved with subsequent attempts.</p>
<h2 id="timeouts"><a class="header" href="#timeouts">Timeouts</a></h2>
<p>When implementing retries, it is important to set appropriate timeouts for each attempt. A timeout defines how long the system should wait for a response before considering the attempt a failure. Setting too short a timeout may lead to unnecessary retries, while too long a timeout can delay the overall operation.</p>
<h2 id="progressive-backoff"><a class="header" href="#progressive-backoff">Progressive Backoff</a></h2>
<p>Progressive backoff is a strategy used to increase the wait time between successive retry attempts. This approach helps to reduce the load on the system and increases the chances of success in subsequent attempts. Common backoff strategies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Backoff</strong>: A constant wait time between retries.</li>
<li><strong>Exponential Backoff</strong>: The wait time increases exponentially with each retry attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Jitter</strong>: Adding randomness to the wait time to prevent synchronized retries from multiple clients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thundering-herd-problem"><a class="header" href="#thundering-herd-problem">Thundering Herd Problem</a></h2>
<p>The thundering herd problem occurs when multiple clients simultaneously retry an operation after a failure, leading to a sudden surge in requests that can overwhelm the system. To mitigate this issue, techniques such as jitter in backoff strategies and limiting the number of concurrent retries can be employed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="webhook"><a class="header" href="#webhook">Webhook</a></h1>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a> is just an endpoint in an API or REST server. A webhook is used to notify internal/external services when certain events happen.</p>
<p>When an event occurs, the server makes an HTTP request (usually a POST request) to the specified URL of the web hook, sending relevant data about the event.</p>
<p>Web hooks are commonly used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time notifications</strong>: Informing external systems about events as they happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data synchronization</strong>: Keeping data in sync between different systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrations</strong>: Connecting different services and automating workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Event-driven architectures</strong>: Triggering actions in response to specific events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Webhooks do not require special technology. You can apply them with any backend technology that can handle HTTP requests.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-tools"><a class="header" href="#why-tools">Why Tools?</a></h1>
<p>An architect needs a couple of tools. I thought a lot about writing this section because this can easily get deprecated since tools keep evolving, but then I decided to talk about the essence of tools we need and give some current recommendations.</p>
<p>An architect does not need many tools, but for engineering, we need lots of tools. For architecture, we need a couple of tools for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagramming</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Thinking</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diagraming"><a class="header" href="#diagraming">Diagraming</a></h1>
<p>Architecture must be visual, it's important to have visual diagrams. In my humble opinion, there are at least 3 diagrams that are very, very useful for architects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html">Overall Architecture</a> Diagram: You can see the big picture, you see how services talk to each other, you see the main components.</li>
<li><a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/10/uml-hidden-gems.html">Class Diagram</a>: Can be useful for 2 common scenarios. A) <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2018/05/internal-system-design-forgotten.html">Internal modeling</a> of a system or B) Modeling tables in a database.</li>
<li>Sequence/state diagrams: Useful to understand how a system works internally, how data flows through the system. I would not have hundreds of these, the goal here is not to have one per UI. The goal is to have them for the most important and complex things.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best paid diagram tool is <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidCHART</a>. The best free diagram tool is <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Diagrams.net</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing"><a class="header" href="#writing">Writing</a></h1>
<p>Architects must <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/01/why-writing-matters.html">write</a>. I used a variety of tools to write like Evernote, Grammarly, Google docs, Markdown files, MS Word, and many others. Today, the best tool for me is Markdown files.</p>
<p>Markdown files are simple and lightweight, they work with any AI Grammar tool. They are also universal and portable. In my humble opinion, I do not have the perfect writing tool yet. I might need to build my own one day, but I think less is more. You need to focus on your ideas, so fewer distractions is the key.</p>
<p>Architects need to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles</li>
<li>Guidelines</li>
<li>Trade-offs</li>
<li>Decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>When you write something down, you are dumping your brain and therefore doing the same as an engineer when they fire up a PR. You are allowing others to review. Written documents scale, because many people can read them, and they might last forever.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="thinking"><a class="header" href="#thinking">Thinking</a></h1>
<p>An architect needs a thinking toolbox. In my humble opinion, you can use the same tool you use for Diagramming and Writing. POC's are a great laboratory for thinking as well. I used a lot of mind-maps in the past, but I find that nowadays I prefer to use plain text files with a good structure (headings, lists, code blocks, etc).</p>
<p>Markdowns can be a great tool for thinking too, but you need a diagram tool to sketch some boxes and arrows. Without coding and experimentation, thinking is just an abstract exercise. When you know the systems and what they can do, then you can think about alternatives. In my humble opinion, thinking is about exploring alternatives, exploring different trade-offs and different ways to solve or model a problem. Thinking is about being creative and open-minded.</p>
<p>There is a difference when you are documenting what you solved already and that's for review or for engineers to implement. Versus thinking about how to solve a problem that is not solved yet. In the first case you are more focused on clarity and precision, in the second case you are more focused on exploration and creativity.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="in-the-end"><a class="header" href="#in-the-end">In The End</a></h1>
<p>Great song. There is no end. Being an architect is a never-ending journey. Software never stops changing, learning never stops. As an architect, you must become a master student so you can become a master teacher.</p>
<p>Teaching is all that matters. The more people know, the fewer bad decisions are made. The more bad decisions are avoided, the better software we all create. There is no winning without learning. The journey does not end here.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-learning"><a class="header" href="#how-to-keep-learning">How to keep learning?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Keep reading books, articles, blogs.</li>
<li>Attend conferences, meetups, webinars.</li>
<li>Teach what you learn, write articles, give talks.</li>
<li>Read code, explore open source projects.</li>
<li>Research new technologies, experiment with them.</li>
<li>Socialize with other architects, share experiences, ask for feedback.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a class="header" href="#final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2>
<p>Architecture is hard. It is a battle that must be <a href="https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/fighting-complexity.html">fought</a> every day. There is no done, there is no resting, so you cannot do all that without love. If you do not have love and passion for learning and teaching, you cannot be a good architect.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can be inspired and you can be a different person tomorrow. To create better architecture, you must become a better architect. Thinking is cheap but is hard at the same time. So spend more time thinking and experimenting.</p>
<p>One last piece of advice: do not forget about output. If you just read, that is not good enough. You need to put it out, so others can review, so you can see if you really know and if it is really good.</p>
<p>Architecture is all about decisions, it's all about trade-offs, so you need to be sure that you are making the right decisions. The only way to be sure is to keep learning and teaching.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="glossary"><a class="header" href="#glossary">Glossary</a></h1>
<p>A comprehensive glossary of technical terms, concepts, patterns, and methodologies covered in this architecture library.</p>
<h2 id="a"><a class="header" href="#a">A</a></h2>
<p><strong>A/B Testing</strong>
An experimental technique to gather data and make informed decisions by comparing two versions of a system. Often implemented using feature flags and experimentation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Methodology</strong>
Development approach emphasizing iterative development, team collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Balances discovery and delivery through continuous feedback cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record (ADR)</strong>
A document recording important architectural decisions, the rationale behind them, consequences, and alternatives considered. Essential for communicating and reviewing architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>
A system quality ensuring that services are accessible and operational to users. A key requirement of distributed systems and emphasized in BASE consistency model.</p>
<p><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong>
A list-based authorization model that explicitly specifies which users or systems can access particular resources.</p>
<p><strong>ACID</strong>
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably even in case of errors or power failures.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Fragility</strong>
A system property where systems not only withstand shocks and stressors but also improve and grow stronger as a result of them.</p>
<p><strong>API Gateway</strong>
A pattern that acts as a single entry point for microservices, handling request routing, response aggregation, authentication, logging, and rate limiting.</p>
<p><strong>API Keys</strong>
An authentication method where a unique key is assigned to clients for identifying and authenticating API requests.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Review</strong>
The practice of documenting architecture decisions, trade-offs, and principles for communication and improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Attention to Detail</strong>
A practice of meticulous examination of code quality, tests, production logs, dashboards, and security audits.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>
The process of verifying the identity of a user or system to ensure the entity requesting access is who they claim to be.</p>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong>
The process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do, defining permissions and access levels for different resources.</p>
<h2 id="b"><a class="header" href="#b">B</a></h2>
<p><strong>Backpressure</strong>
A situation where incoming message rate exceeds processing capacity, leading to latency and potential message loss.</p>
<p><strong>Blue-Green Deployment</strong>
A deployment strategy where two identical production environments are maintained, with traffic switched from the blue environment to the green environment, enabling instant rollback if issues occur.</p>
<p><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong>
When new code can read data written by old code, requiring new services to provide defaults for missing fields.</p>
<p><strong>BASE</strong>
Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent - a consistency model used by many NoSQL databases that prioritizes availability over immediate consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Backend for Frontend (BFF)</strong>
A pattern creating separate backend services tailored to specific frontend applications' needs, typically containing rendering logic.</p>
<p><strong>Big Ball of Mud</strong>
An anti-pattern where a system has no recognizable architecture, with haphazardly structured code that is difficult to maintain and extend.</p>
<p><strong>Biometric Verification</strong>
An authentication method using unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify identity.</p>
<p><strong>Build vs Buy Dilemma</strong>
The decision between building solutions in-house for core business advantages or buying external solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Build Status</strong>
The state of the automated build process, which should consistently pass in stable systems as indicator of code quality.</p>
<h2 id="c"><a class="header" href="#c">C</a></h2>
<p><strong>Canary Release</strong>
A deployment strategy where new code is gradually rolled out to a small percentage of users first, allowing observation of behavior and issues before full deployment. Often enabled through feature flags.</p>
<p><strong>Code Review</strong>
A practice where engineers examine and critique code changes before they are merged, enabling knowledge sharing, quality assurance, and identification of potential issues.</p>
<p><strong>Cache</strong>
A software component storing data for faster future access, commonly used in web browsers, databases, and operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Oriented Services</strong>
A principle that services should be organized around business capabilities rather than technical layers, promoting better alignment with business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Engineering</strong>
A practice of inducing and provoking failure in systems and infrastructure to prove system tolerance and recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Conceptual Drift</strong>
An anti-pattern where systems gradually deviate from the intended architecture over time, losing coherence and consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Conceptual Integrity</strong>
A principle emphasizing consistency and coherence in system design, ensuring all parts work together harmoniously under a unified vision.</p>
<p><strong>Class Diagram</strong>
A UML diagram useful for internal system design modeling or database table modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Connection Pool</strong>
A cache of database connections maintained so connections can be reused for future database requests, reducing the cost of opening/closing connections.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>
The property that data in a system is in a valid state and follows all defined rules and constraints. Can be immediate as in ACID transactions or eventual as in BASE consistency model.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent Hashing</strong>
A partitioning technique for distributed systems ensuring stable distribution when nodes are added/removed.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Refactoring</strong>
The ongoing process of improving code structure and design without changing external behavior, essential for maintaining code quality and preventing technical debt accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Contract-Driven Design</strong>
An approach where services are designed around their contracts first, ensuring well-defined boundaries and compatibility before implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Delay</strong>
A Lean concept measuring the cost of waiting versus deciding immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Ball (Foresight)</strong>
A practice of thinking ahead and predicting future changes to architecture, allowing preparation for upcoming needs.</p>
<p><strong>Credential Rotation</strong>
The process of periodically changing credentials and keys to reduce the risk from long-term exposure if a credential is compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Cursor-Based Pagination</strong>
A pagination method using a cursor (unique identifier) to mark the starting point for the next page.</p>
<h2 id="d"><a class="header" href="#d">D</a></h2>
<p><strong>Database Migration</strong>
The process of modifying database schema to support application changes, often requiring special care to execute without downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Data Migration</strong>
