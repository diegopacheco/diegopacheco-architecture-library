# Rationale

I wrote other books like Building Scala Applications, Principles of Software Architecture Modernisation and Continnous Modernization. This book is on the similar themes, however this is not a traditional book. It's a open source git book. It's only and you don't need to pay.

The tool I'm using here is very nice, it allow to search the whole book, in any page just type `/` in your keyboard and start typing what you want to search for. also because this book is written based on `markdown` it's very easy to link any page because you have a link per page. 

Because I'm using git, I have history of all changes. Because this is made with software, I can update the book, so the book is versioned. Look on the footer of every page and you will see the version of the book.

This is a way for me to give it back. For free . I hope you enjoy it.
