# Crystal Ball

Architects must have a good crystal ball. Requirements change, a requirement change can break completely the architecture if it was not designed to accommodate change. So thinking ahead is a great practice because it allows you to predict the next moves, meaning you think big and ahead but execute small.

Code can and should be refactored. Refactoring should happen all the time and continuously. However there are people who are allergic to refactoring and that is a recipe for great disasters. Thinking ahead allows you to be prepared when you need it. Think about fire drills, you practice how to handle fire, so when you need it you are ready. 

Think big execute small.
