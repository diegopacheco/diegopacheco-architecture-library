# Open Source First

Open Source must be the default. Avoid proprietary software. Do not build wrappers for open source libraries. Use Open Source software directly. Building internal shared libraries is a liability and will create many issues like security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden, and lack of community support / documentation. Therefore creating internal shared libraries must be a very conscious choice and must be well justified.
