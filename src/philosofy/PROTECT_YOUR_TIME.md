It is very easy to be [consumed with meetings](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/07/meetings-cost.html) 100% of the time. However, the architect must protect their time in order to do deep work: research, monthly reviews, crystal balling, thinking about trade-offs, evaluating solutions, and reading code.

At minimum, you should book at least 3 times per week for 3-6 hours to do deep work. It does not matter if it is in the morning or afternoon, whatever is easier. Hold your ground, push back, and protect that time. Architects must think.
