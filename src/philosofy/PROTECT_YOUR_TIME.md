# Protect Your Time

It's very easy to be consumed with meetings 100% of the time. However the architect must protect his time in order to do deep work. Research, Monthly Reviews, Crystall Balling, thinking about trade-offs, evaluating solutions and reading code.

At minimun you should book at least 3x per week 3-6h to do deep work. Does not matter if is in the morning or aftermoon, whatever is easier. Hold your ground, push back, and protect that time. Architects must think.
