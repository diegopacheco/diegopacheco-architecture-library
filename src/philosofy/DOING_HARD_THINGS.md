# Doing Hard Things

Proper software is hard. It's a never ending war. Doing the right things means, teaching, socializing, influencing, enforcing, convincing, pushing back, standing your ground, and giving all sweat and blood to make the right things happen.

The best things in software are HARD:
* Doing the right design
* Keeping discipline to write tests and have high diversity and coverage
* Calling out and teaching team members with poor practices and wrong beliefs.
* Pushing back poorly written tickets and requirements
* Saying NO to "false shortcuts" (that lead to anti-patterns and tech debt)
* Doing the right things everyday (invisible ant work)

Architects must do HARD THINGS all the time.
