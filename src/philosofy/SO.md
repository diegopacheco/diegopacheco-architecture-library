# Service Orientation

[Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2014/11/soa-micro-services-and-isolation.html) is a big deal. SOA should be the default way of thinking and operating services in modern software architecture. Service Orientation should be the default choice for solutions. Services are more important and better than internal libraries.

Services allow Isolation, Independence and Flexibility. When services are done right, with proper contracts, refactor can happen under the hood. Services allow different stacks and technology.

Services should be Capability oriented. Services should be as generic as possible and it's okay to have more granularity and more code in a service. Services do not need to be micro(Micro Services).
