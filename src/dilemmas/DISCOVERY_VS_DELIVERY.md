# Discovery Vs Delivery

Discovery it's the moment where you are trying to figure out what to build in order to solve a problem for your users. Discovery it's heavily around product and user research, prototyping, testing ideas and validating assumptions.

However it's also necessary have someone from technology doing discovery otherwise you transfer slowness, confusion and risk even to be attempting to build something that is not pheasable or too complex to deliver.

Delivery should be focusing on engineering and once we know what to build(often capture as requirements and figma prototypes for the frontend) we can start building it. The question is how I build it right. Sounds simple right? But here we have one of the biggest dilemmas in software development. 

IF you just go from discovery to delivery you very likely is working in a waterfall fashion. So this is not linear, but (I consider an anti-pattern), but happens all the time, the moment you touch discovery, people assume discovery is done or correct and them you only care aboud shipping it fast.

You need speed, but is not just speed of delivery but actually speed of learning. The goal is to learn fast. sometimes you can learn before production but often times you can only goto production to learn.

If you need goto production fast to learn, should we embrace the `Tech Debt plague` and be `Tech Debt First`? No. Because you might learn what the users want or don't want, you might find what can bring revenue to the compamny but the code is there(likely forever) and we need balance this. So you can't just `pick a side` you need to balance both sides.
