# Build vs Buy

Which one is best, build or buy? Well, it depends. Build is important when is your core domain and is how your companies makes money and differentiates from the competition. If all the companies by the same core business, how are they different? They are not. 

However when is not your core business, buy makes a lot of sense, because is freeing time for you to focus on what matters, your core business. Howeber this is a big mistake here. There is no buy without build. Because even if you buy you will need integrate with your existing systems. Just because your buy does not means is perfect, does not means it fixes all your problems. It's also comon when you buy solution that same solutions introduce problems that you did not have before. 

When buying it's important to observe:
* Make sure there are APIs
* Evaluate the APIs before buying
* Buy the code (when possible)
* Consider integration as part of the cost
* Consider troubleshooting, debugging, observability as part of the cost

If I use an AWS service, vs building in house is cheaper? Well dependends where you want put the money. In the beginning buying might sound cheaper, but you will pay AWS forever. When you build you might have a better solution(if executed right) but you now need pay people to mantaining it forever. So where you want the money goes, your people or vendors? The question here is how good you are in execution inside of the house. If your execution is terrible, go buy.
