# Decide or Wait

Lean belive that late decisions are often better than rushed ones. However, waiting too long can lead to missed opportunities. As time pass, you will be more equiped about whatt's best, thay it's always easier to refactor later(If the cost is not too high).

Decisions are process, they they should not be written on the stone. Deciding something is process, it allow us to move on, however we should be challenging our past decisions, that's why time to reflect and think is importat. Architects need protect they time to have time to think. Engineering teams must have retrospectives to reflect on past decisions.

Sometimes is too soon to decide, you might not have data or not be sure. You must balance the cost of waiting vs the cost of deciding now. Lean has a tool to deal with this called `cost of delay`. If the cost of delay is low, you can wait more, if it's high you must decide now.

Experimentation is a good way to make temporary decisions, and them figureout what stick and what does not stick. You can try A/B testing, feature flags, or prototypes to gather data and make informed decisions later. Deciding and waiting are not mutually exclusive, they require balance.
