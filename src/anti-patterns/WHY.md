# Why Anti-Patterns?

Everybody talks about patterns. Everything on the internet is "Best Practices." But people do not understand principles correctly. People think they understand when they actually do not.

I saw that lack of "proper application" happen over and over the years, with Agile, with Microservices, with DevOps, with Docker. If you do not understand the principles behind those "practices," you will end up doing anti-patterns.

Some anti-patterns are obvious and related to technology, but many anti-patterns are related to people, process, culture, and how you work as a team. Also, there are anti-patterns related to how architects behave or how they do not behave (and should behave).

It is important to know what is wrong, so you can avoid doing it.
