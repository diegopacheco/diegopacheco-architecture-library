# Why Anti-Patterns?

Everyboddy talks about patternws. Everything on the internet is "Best Prarctices". But people don't undersnd principles correctely, people think they understand when they actually don't.

I saw that lack of "proper application" happen over and over the years, with Agile, with Microservices, With DevOps, with Docker. If you dont understand the principles behind those "practices" you will end up doing anti-patterns.

Some anti-patterns are obvious and related to technology, but many anti-patterns are related to people, process, culture and how you work as a team. Also there are anti-patterns related to how architects behave or how they do not behave(and should behave).

It's important to know that is wrong, so you can avoid doing it.
