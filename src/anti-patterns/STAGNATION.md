# Stagnation

Architects must be like the Rolling Stones, they dont gatter moss. Architects must be in a constant state of learning, alwayd reading books, always reading papers, alwayd reading code, always ahead of the curve. 

IF an architect stops learning, they stagnate, and stagnation is the death of architecture. Think about a coin, a coin that has no circulation is a worthless coin. An architect that has no new knowledge is a worthless architect.

As architect you cannot become old school. You must be always looking for new ideas, new technologies, new patterns, new anti-patterns, new ways of doing the old things. Being stuck on the past has terrible consequences. The architect is the most influencial person or it should be. So what are you influencing?
