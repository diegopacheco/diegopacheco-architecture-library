# Requirements

Mind Blow by me saying "Requirements" is an anti-pattern? Lean belives that requirements are just a decision that somebody made. Now  what you need to ask your self is, how good is this decision? Architecture is the art of making good decisions. Bad decisios COST a lot, not only money but also time, effort and frustration.

Architects `MUST` make good decisions. Good decisions are made when you have the right information, the right context and the right experience. You must be prepared to make right decisions. In the begining you will make mistakes, which is okay if you learn from them and that's why you need Architecture Review.

Not all Requirements are anti-patterns, but seeing them as "requiremenrts" it's an anti-patter per se. The word requirements, and often how people take it is that, implies that something is fixed, immutable and unchangeable. In reality, requirements are always changing, evolving and adapting to new circumstances. Good architects embrace change and adapt their decisions accordingly.

When a project starts, or when you start a task, it's very common that product did not tought a lot about the consequences, trade-offs, corner cases, implications and or even what the engineering team needs to get it done. The most common anti-pattern is empty jira tickets and tons of meetings to push the "discovery work" to engineering. 

There is nothing wrong in engineering colaborating with product, as long as we mark that as "Discovery work". The issue is, product push "not ready" tickets to development and ask: "Why is this not done yet?" them corners are cut, quality is compromised and technical debt is added. Remeber the Tech Debt Plague and Ignoring culture, they are all connected.

You need see requirements are "Temporary decisions", not as martial law. You need develier requirements, but you must challenge them, you must question them and you must validate them. If you don't, you are just a delivery team, not an engineering team.
