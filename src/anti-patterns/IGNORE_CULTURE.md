# Ignore Culture

If something is wrong. Say something, do something. When you ignore problems consistenly over a long period of time, you end up developing this anti-pattern, which I called "Ignore Culture".

When you ignore warnings in the build, when you ignore old versions of libraries, when you ignore anti-patterns on the code. When you ignore production monitoring. When you ignore requirements that make no sense.

Does not matter if you was the one who did the code or not. You must take ownsership and under your watch you should ignore nothing. 

Ignoring can be a culture because managers can easily do this. Engineers, often pressure by managers also can ignore several wrong things. Whats wrong should not be ignore it sohuld be fight and push back.

Lack of fithing for whats it's right is imaturity.As an arhitect you must not ignore whats wrong. Do not let this become a culture. Ignore culture can happen so easily people "It's not my job", or "It's not my code" or "It's not my project" or "It's not my resposability", the extreme lack of ownership can lead to ignore culture.

When you are ignoring problem you are makign fertile ground for anti-patterns to grow. Tech debt plague requires ignore culture to thrive.
