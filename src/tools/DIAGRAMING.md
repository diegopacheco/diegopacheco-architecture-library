# Diagraming

Architecture must be visual, it's important to have visual diagrams. IMHO there are least 3 diagrams that are very, very useful for architects:
* Overall Architecture Diagram: You can see the big pucture, you see how services talk to each other, you see the main components.
* Class Diagram: Can be useful for 2 common scenarios. A) Internal modeling of a system or B) Modeling tables in a database.
* Sequence/state diagrams: Useful to understand how a system works internally, how data flows through the system. I would not have hundreds of theese, the goal here is not have one per UI. The goal is to have for the most important and most complex things.
