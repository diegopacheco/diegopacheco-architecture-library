# Diagraming

Architecture must be visual, it's important to have visual diagrams. In my humble opinion, there are at least 3 diagrams that are very, very useful for architects:
* [Overall Architecture](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html) Diagram: You can see the big picture, you see how services talk to each other, you see the main components.
* [Class Diagram](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/10/uml-hidden-gems.html): Can be useful for 2 common scenarios. A) [Internal modeling](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2018/05/internal-system-design-forgotten.html) of a system or B) Modeling tables in a database.
* Sequence/state diagrams: Useful to understand how a system works internally, how data flows through the system. I would not have hundreds of these, the goal here is not to have one per UI. The goal is to have them for the most important and complex things.
