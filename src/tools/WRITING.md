# Writing

Architects must [write](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/01/why-writing-matters.html). I used a variety of tools to write like Evernote, Grammarly, Google docs, Markdown files, MS Word, and many others. Today, the best tool for me is Markdown files.

Markdown files are simple and lightweight, they work with any AI Grammar tool. They are also universal and portable. In my humble opinion, I do not have the perfect writing tool yet. I might need to build my own one day, but I think less is more. You need to focus on your ideas, so fewer distractions is the key.

Architects need to write:
* Principles
* Guidelines
* Trade-offs
* Decisions

When you write something down, you are dumping your brain and therefore doing the same as an engineer when they fire up a PR. You are allowing others to review. Written documents scale, because many people can read them, and they might last forever.
