# Thinking

An architect needs a thinking toolbox. IMHO you can use the same tool you use for `Diagramming` and `Writting`. POC's are a great laboratory for thinking as well. I used a lot of mind-maps in the past, but I find that nowadays I prefer to use plain text files with a good structure (headings, lists, code blocks, etc).

Markdowns can be a great tool for thinking too, but you need a diagram tool to sketch some boxes and arrows. Without coding and experimentation, thinking is just an abstract exercise. When you know the systems, and know what they can do them you can think about alternatives IMHO thinking is about exploring alternatives, exploring different trade-offs and different ways to solve or model a problem. Thinking is about being creative and open-minded.

There is a different when you are documenting what you solved already and that's for review or for engineers to implement. Versus thinking about how to solve a problem that is not solved yet. In the first case you are more focused on clarity and precision, in the second case you are more focused on exploration and creativity.
