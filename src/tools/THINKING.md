# Thinking

An architect needs a thinking toolbox. In my humble opinion, you can use the same tool you use for Diagramming and Writing. POC's are a great laboratory for thinking as well. I used a lot of mind-maps in the past, but I find that nowadays I prefer to use plain text files with a good structure (headings, lists, code blocks, etc).

Markdowns can be a great tool for thinking too, but you need a diagram tool to sketch some boxes and arrows. Without coding and experimentation, thinking is just an abstract exercise. When you know the systems and what they can do, then you can think about alternatives. In my humble opinion, thinking is about exploring alternatives, exploring different trade-offs and different ways to solve or model a problem. Thinking is about being creative and open-minded.

There is a difference when you are documenting what you solved already and that's for review or for engineers to implement. Versus thinking about how to solve a problem that is not solved yet. In the first case you are more focused on clarity and precision, in the second case you are more focused on exploration and creativity.

## Why you need to know this?

Because architecture is not just "choosing something". It's about a deep analytical and critical thinking process. It's very easy to just dump more software. Lateral thinking requires practice and discipline. Architects need to think, otherwise they are just engineering following instructions from product.

Thinking is a must for architects. It must happen, otherwise the role of the architect is not effective. However nobody will tell you to think, actually the opposite, they will pressure to deliver and it does not matter if you think or not. So you better master the art of thinking, the art of trade-offs, the art of doing POCs, and the art of making good decisions based on your thinking.
