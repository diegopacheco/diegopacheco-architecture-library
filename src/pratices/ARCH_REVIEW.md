# Architecture Review

If you don't have anything written, how can we review it? How can you communicate with the engineering team? How can you onboard new team members?

Architecture must be written down, at the minimum:
* Overall Architecture Diagram
* Key Decisions (with rationale)
* Important [Trade-offs](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/07/tradeoffs.html)

Arch documentation can be done with a markdown file, here is a good template: https://github.com/diegopacheco/tech-resources/blob/master/arch-doc-template.md

When you write down, principles, decisions, guidance, and trade-offs become explicit, easier to communicate, and easier to review. Diagrams help a lot, especially overall architecture diagram, class diagram are very useful.
