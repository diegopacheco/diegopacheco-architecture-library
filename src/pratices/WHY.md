# Why Practices?

Architecture is not just about technology. Architecture is also about people, and what and how you work with the team.

The way you work matters, what you do and what you do not do (consciously) also matter.

Practices are about "how you do things," the way you approach problems, day-to-day life, difficult situations, decisions, and trade-offs.
