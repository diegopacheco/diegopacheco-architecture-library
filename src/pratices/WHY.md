# Why Pratices?

Architecture is not just about technology. architecture is also about people, and what and how you work with team.

The way you work matter, what you do and what you dont do(conciously) also matter.

Pratices are about "how you do things", the way you approach problems, day-by-day life, difficult situations, decisions, trade-offs.
