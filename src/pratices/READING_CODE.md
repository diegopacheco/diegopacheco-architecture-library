# Reading Code

I know this might sound silly. But Architects need to [read the code](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/training-like-pros.html), they should go download the code and read it. Not only read it but [analyze](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2022/12/code-analysis-at-scale.html) it. Reading the code allow the architect to:
* Understand the complexity of the system
* See the anti-patterns on the code
* Understand what the system does

Many meetings can be saved if people just read the code. Architects must be Hackers, they need to read the code. Read the system code, read the libraries code, read the frameworks code. Reading code is not a one time thing, is a everyday thing.
