# Design First

Architects must think. They must produce the [design](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2021/04/design-is-not-subjective.html) before the implementation. However, that's only possible if the architect masters the problem domain and the technology being used. If that does not happen, Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are a great way to explore the problem and the technology before the design is produced.

Writing down the [design](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/04/architecture-101-thinking-about-design.html) is also a great way to communicate it to the team and get feedback. The [design](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2020/08/design-101.html) should be a living document that evolves with the project. If you jump into executing all the time you are doing just tactical programming (Philosophy of software design).

If you move before you think, tech debt will happen, bad decisions will happen.
