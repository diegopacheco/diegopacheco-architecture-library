# Why Properties?

Properties are characteristics or attributes that define or describe an object, system, or concept. Properties give us benefits. Without architecture properties, we would be lost in a sea of ambiguity and confusion.

Properties are things you really want for your architecture and systems. Think about a kid, you want your son or daughter to have good properties like honesty, kindness, and respectfulness. Similarly, in architecture and systems, we want properties that ensure scalability, security, and observability.

Some properties are obvious, others are non-obvious. But if you know they exist you can make explict work to make sure theu are present in your architecture and systems.
