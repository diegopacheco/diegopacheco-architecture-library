# Secure

Software must be secure. Architects should prioritize security in their designs to protect data and maintain user trust. Lack of security runs brands, trust is damaged, and legal consequences may arise.

Security means implementing measures to protect systems from threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. This includes practices like encryption, authentication, authorization, and regular security audits.

Common considerations for secure architecture:
- **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only
- **Regular Updates**: Keep software and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Architects need to know security. Architecture must be designed with security in mind from the outset, rather than being an afterthought. This includes threat modeling, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring for potential vulnerabilities.

By prioritizing security in software architecture, organizations can safeguard their systems, protect user data, and maintain trust with their users.
