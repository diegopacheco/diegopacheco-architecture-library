# Scalability

A good architect, produce good architecture. Architecture is embedided in code. Good code is scalable code.

Scalability it's not only for systems, it's also for engineering teams. A good architecture allows teams to work in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.

Good Structure, good design, allow engineers to be more productive, and focus on delivering value, instead of fighting with the codebase. You want the architects you produce to have this properties.
