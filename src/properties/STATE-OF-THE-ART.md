# State of the Art

If you will be building something. Why start with something deprecated? Why not use the latest versions? State of the art is not about just using the latest and greatest versions but also picking the best solutions.

Why not pick the best database? why not pick the best language? why not pick the best framework? why not pick the best architecture?

We should be creating the best architecture and the best solutions, just going with the "standards" is a path to stagnation.

This might sound impossible, but it's not. It just requires more research and more effort. But is 100% doable and should be done.
