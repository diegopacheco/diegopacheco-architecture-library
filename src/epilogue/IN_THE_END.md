# In The End

Great song. There is no end. Being an architect it's a never ending journey. Software never stop changing, learning never stops. As a architect you must become a master student so you can become a master teacher.

Teaching it's all that matters, the more people know, the less bad decisions are made. The more bad decisions are avoided, the better software we all create. There is no winning without learning. The journey do not end here. 

## How to keep learning?

1. Keep reading books, articles, blogs.
2. Attend conferences, meetups, webinars.
3. Teach what you learn, write articles, give talks.
4. Read code, explore open source projects.
5. Research new technologies, experiment with them.
6. Socialize with other architects, share experiences, ask for feedback.

## Final Thoughts

Architecture it's hard. It's a battle it must be [fight](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2023/08/fighting-complexity.html) everyday. There is no done, there is not resting, so you can't do all thst without love. If you dont have love and passion for learning and teaching you can't be a good architect.

The good news is that you can be inspired and you can be a different person tomorrow. To create better architecture you must become a better architect. Thinking is cheap but is hard at the same time. So spead more time thinking and experimenting.

One last advice, do not forget about output. If you just read, that's not good enought you need put it out, so other can review, so you can see if you really know and if is really good. 

Architecture is all about decisions, it's all about trade-offs, so you need to be sure that you are making the right decisions. The only way to be sure is to keep learning and teaching.
