# Why Concepts?

Without knowing key concepts, you did not really learn something properly. Knowing concepts allows you to build mental models that help you understand new information faster and better.

Without mental models, you are just memorizing information, and that is not a good way to learn and the worst way to operate. Mental models can only be built with proper understanding of concepts.

Having good mental models is a game changer, because it allows you to:
- Learn new things faster
- Understand complex topics better
- Make better decisions
- Solve problems more effectively
- Communicate ideas clearly
