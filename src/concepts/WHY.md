# Why Concepts?

Without know key concepts you did not really learned something properly. Knowing concepts, allow you to build mental models that help you understand new information faster and better.

Without mental models you are just memorizing information, and that is not a good way to learn and worst way to operate. Mental models can only be build with proper understanding of concepts.

Having good mental moels is a game changer, because it allows you to:
- Learn new things faster
- Understand complex topics better
- Make better decisions
- Solve problems more effectively
- Communicate ideas clearly
